ANNOUNCEMENT:  
  
Hello u/everyone.  
  
We have received several reports of delayed transactions and/or missing assets/tokens after purchases/transfers.  
  
As you may already be aware, Solana sometimes has network congestions that result in transactions taking hours to complete.  
  
For now, please give any transaction 24 hours to self-solve. This includes wallet-to-spending, spending-to-wallet, and wallet-to-wallet transfers.  
  
If you're still experiencing issues even after waiting for 24 hours, please tag me &lt;@!372422575818539029&gt; so I can help you.  
  
Thank you!

So many of my patients think not enough stretching is the reason they have sore muscles, get injured and cannot perform at their best.    
Today I dive into whether stretching is as important for runners as so many people seem to think.

I don‚Äôt even see your point when people are buying tons of sol gst to level up and mint shoes. The Solana shoes marketplace is flying due to BSC. In turn giving StepN more revenue. 

When BSC user base gets on the same level as Solana the prices will even out and a token bridge will be an option.

56;yonks;"STEPN on BSC requires different sneakers than on Solana as the NFTs are not compatible cross chain. There is more demand for Sneakers than there are people earning GST on BSC resulting in very high GST prices on GSC.

To answer your question about whether now is a good time to buy Sneakers ‚Ä¶

If you are looking to get started on Solana ‚Ä¶ with the recent crypto downturn, SOL is about 50% less than it was last month. The floor prices, in SOL, have remained fairly consistent. This means if you are converting fiat to SOL ‚Ä¶ you can get your Sneakers for ~50% less than someone a month ago.

Either way ‚Ä¶ the sooner that you get started, the sooner you can start your journey and ROI. This is a game that rewards consistency.";0;2022-05-22 23:53:12;t3_uvml3c;/r/StepN/comments/uvml3c/guys_there_is_something_i_really_dont_understand/i9mgtpd/

In the STEPN program, I charged my account to Solna 13 to pay for shoes.  
Sorry, the program was automatically logged out  
And then no matter how hard I tried to login again, I got the error that the password or username was wrong  
Anyway, I logged in again today with the new activation code  
I entered the 12-word Walt password, but it's zero since I deposited 13 SOLNAs into Walt's spanding account.  
The spanding account is also zero  
Total game inventory is zero  
But it shows the history of receiving Solna in Walt.

60;Ark3tech;"You can't compare all crypto to Terra and just live in constant fear.  Bitcoin has existed for 14 years without one hack.  BTC is solid as a rock, and that would need to fail in order to bring the rest of the crypto market down.

The Terra crash was a black swan event.  Much like bitconnect from the early days. Do Kwan made some major mistakes that people were able to exploit and crash the UST price that was tethered to Terra.

STEPN can crash sure, but I expect to have reached my ROI and then some before that happens. Also, SOL will not remain $50 forever.  This won't be going away for awhile.  We have a whole Summer ahead of us with people jumping in this app.  Prices could still continue to fall in the short term, but that trend will eventually reverse.

Mostly larger projects are totally silent because they grew too fast (like STEPN) and dont have support to keep up with requests. That happens all the time with the crypto projects or exchanges, they just dont care about individual cases because it is overwhelming for them and benefits of helping individual user are negligible. 

Harsh and unfair but it is how it is. Crypto is very hostile in terms of helping people, without communities most of the people would be lost on crypto.

179;fatbutbald;"I wrote this comment on another post (asking if stepn is a ponsi scam), but fits here too:

I just realized that you don't need to get 100% of your investment back for it to be profitable. My shoes cost 18 sol, and lets say the game only exists for another 4 months: 

EVEN IF I spent some of my GST on leveling up and buying more shoes, and only got back *half* of my initial investment, there is still a health benefit, and I say this as a fat lazy guy that just lays on the sofa all day, 

Stepn has made me go out EVERY SINGLE DAY, most days twice to walk/jog, in +35¬∞C. I think that the health benefit /lifestyle change that 4 months of daily exercising does is worth 9 SOL on its own, probably more! 

If stepn stopped working today, I would still be 98% more likely to keep walking 10 minutes every day than I was before. And if Stepn was still around, but had a 90% drop in GST rewards, I could still walk myself into getting a free weekly beer. üòÅ

I'm the (almost) the furthest from a health nut you can get (I don't smoke or do drugs, *yet*) but I can actually see myself doing daily exercises now, even *without* stepn. And this after only two weeks. What about after 2 months?? 

Hell, if I could deposit $1000 with a smart contract in Stepn and *earn them back* (perhaps even with some interest?) I would do it, to FORCE myself to do the work, every day!

Some people then call it a ponzi scheme because new users are forced to buy a shoe. But shoe purchase is in sol or bnb. So these two have a utility and Stepn users will buy them increasing the value of those coins. But this doesn't influence gst positively, in fact it just results in more gst being released onto the market. Which will devaluate GST. So these points that the show can only last while new users are coming only counts for minting strategies not for walking strategies. So what reason do people have to buy gst and keep our lovely returns up or make them higher in the long term, what utilities could there be to buying GST?;0;2022-05-20 17:52:25;t3_uu23ja;/r/StepN/comments/uu23ja/discussion_post_stepn_longevity/i9cut0y/

192;exivor01;"In this scenario, 1 minter can only hold off the selling pressure of 18 common walkers (10 GST per day each, if everyone holds 1 common walker separately.) now, not everyone is walking with only 1 common shoe, many are going for at least 3 shoes for 4 energy and others are going for 9 sneakers etc. We have no way of knowing how many minters there are, but as long as we have enough, we should be burning more GST than daily generated GST's. And not everyone who earns is selling directly.   


But it's not like this, I have the proof. go check dextools and you can see for yourself as well. Every day, the total circulating GST number is rising. That means there's just not enough burs happening, not enough minters. And this is how it is supposed to happen. You can never have more minters because thousands of people will just want to run and sell gst for a quick profit. And as we reach higher users, the majority of them will be walkers who just sell GST. Not minters. Because to become a minter, you need to make calculations and a plan. not everyone can do that, or think about that. So I don't like the idea of stepn having millions of users. We can never sustain such sell pressure. And those millions of people will arrive because of daily 30$ earnings. When that is no longer sustainable, they will dump the market. So it's NEVER a good idea to reach that many users IMO.   


That's why I'm keeping my risk very very low on stepn. Not investing too much into it. ""I already ROI'd anyways"" Stepn is like a bomb waiting to explode, again this is just my opinion. Also, don't even think about GMT holding after GST dumps below 1 dollar. At that point, there will be no hype or trust left for the project. And switching from GST to GMT in the long run isn't feasible as well, because majority of the players ar efixing their shoes and buying their shoes by considering the GST earnings. What will happen to all of those shoes? Even if stat reset comes, GMT is coming from comfort level, we've all been trying to buy high EFF and RES stat shoes. all of those shoe's prices will dump.";0;2022-05-20 14:44:16;t3_ut6sgn;/r/StepN/comments/ut6sgn/can_someone_answer_this_please/i9c2hua/

210;scenia;"I think it will happen around the time renting is released. At that point, there's little reason for new users to buy in since they can just rent, so demand for sneakers will drop to the point where only those who are willing to pay for the shortcut buy sneakers when they start playing. In other words, once renting is here, only your typical whales will buy sneakers to start, so that's when the equilibrium should happen. It could come a little earlier due to anticipation or a little later due to market inertia, but I'd expect it to be somewhere within +/-1 month of renting release.

It should be noted that when that happens, even at $0.1/GST, we're still looking at ~$1 for a 10 minute daily walk on a decent lv9 walker. At that point, ROI will become less important and people will reinvest their earnings, building up their collection in order to reach high energy and high quality shoes, that's honestly the point where this becomes really interesting as a game. And that's why I think a low GST price is a blessing in disguise.

By the way, even someone who bought in at $1000/shoe would break even in 3 years once we're at 0.1, which is a 33% return. Unless stepn completely burns down (which would surprise me very much), we're still talking about a fantastic return many investors wouldn't even dream about.";0;2022-05-20 09:47:44;t3_utdd4t;/r/StepN/comments/utdd4t/new_user_growth_will_slow_down_thats_innevitable/i9b4tfg/

249;scenia;It basically depends on how much money is coming in through outside investors. At the end of the day, there's nothing that inherently generates money in stepn, so the money anyone cashes out is the same money someone else puts in. This can go the same way it went with Bitcoin, with prices going up over time for a long time, but the question is why would anyone use GST over other cryptos. As long as it has utility in the app, there's an incentive to buy GST and burn it, but once prices do drop, the benefit of that decreases and people will be less willing to pay for it, putting more downward pressure on the price. This is why people expect GST to go down to the cents range, where it will probably stabilize because the app does offer non-financial benefits that are worth money to some people.;0;2022-05-19 21:33:29;t3_utdd4t;/r/StepN/comments/utdd4t/new_user_growth_will_slow_down_thats_innevitable/i993e4s/

Just think about it, Asics jumped in super early, there are a ton of sport suppliers who would be interested not only to make marketing but have more reallife customers for their products.
Furthermore health care and insurance, if Stepn gets part of that and maybe gives a benefit for their clients in terms of reduced fees (healthy customers cost less) they can have much better information on their clients than ever before. Netherless to talk about events like any marathon on the world, for the start it would be just be a digital twin for these events, but couldnt you imagine that the whole tracking for these events could possible done with Stepn.

Sure everything is big picture and yes, Stepn is Ponzi-like for now but the potential is huge and I want to be part of it.
With wise management and awesome control of the supply &amp; demand within Stepns eco-system, it could balance to a point until it really becomes an accepted and powerful platform for a ton of use cases.

In that case the game still incentivized loads of people to go run and do something for their health (this actually has proven to be the case when you read through the reddit here).   


But one thing that I think needs to be pointed out is that any crypto-game or even any economy works in exactly the same way. Money getting pushed back and forth.

It‚Äôs quite ingenious. Kind of like mixing a no-production and maintenance cost Gym-membership (New Years resolution: book for 2 years and only go for a month), a casino (Roulette, BlackJack) with a sports-based game (reward through endorphins release + monetary (seemingly) rewards). All this makes StepN highly addictive and lucrative.

Even Facebook and YouTube weren‚Äôt always profit-producing. In the starting phase there usually are investors and a push to get as many people onto the platform as possible. That‚Äôs the phase we are in at the moment. Eventually, the real monetisation comes where either user-data is sold, adds are brought in and sold, the rewards are lowered and there is so much more governance and complexity, that it gets really difficult to calculate if you are actually making profit or just staying hooked into the system while paying for it (and not even noticing).";0;2022-05-19 15:56:38;t3_ut36a8;/r/StepN/comments/ut36a8/how_does_stepn_make_money_just_running_and/i97rzv7/

291;No_Attorney777;No, you earn it. You buy shoes, they produce coins. To earn more coins, you have to spend that coin. To earn more fast track, you have to buy these coins from the market. Yes, in a way it works like a ponzi, because you have to have influx of new players, but so does every crypto project. Look at it similarly to staking coins with interest. You invest (lock in) money and get back more in some period of time. If during that period coin decreases in value, with staking you actually lose money while here you just need more time to get the same amount. Besides all that, Stepn is the most famous and popular and well working move to earn app. It‚Äôs pretty much crypto punks, bored apes or bitcoin of m2e industry.

301;xlDooM;As I understand it, new users create demand for both SOL and GST which drives up the price, but as their strategies settle in at the level of investment they are comfortable at, they become pure GST suppliers which drives down the price of GST and eventually SOL. I expect that once the ratio of new users to stale earners drops too low, GST will eventually tank. The devs have a lot of mechanisms to keep demand for GST as long as possible though, but it can't be infinite.

If you run like 5 or less min/km pace is pretty though (thats 2km per session), sprints are usually even faster. If you run 6 min/km is like average pace and it is not that though, but than you are pretty close to lower edge of stepn range for runner. If your signal is not perfect it could cause to fall under the lower edge of runner shoe. Happened to me lot of times when I run at slower pace.

I recommend to level up shoe up to level 9 that is 50gst and 10gmt overall and 45 hours wait overall, in around 5 days you could be level 9. It will give you reasonable earnings around 10gst per day.

I had a runner for a month, and it was not worth at all for me. I sold it. Running every day even for a 10 minutes is just overwhelming. Also consider you need to buy real shoes that are good, because if you run in like some cheap ass shoes your legs will start to hurt, joints will also suffer, could get injured and so on especially if you never run before.

I am not some lazy dude that doesnt run at all, before stepn I run like 2,3 times a week for 30min-60minutes, and it was still overwhelming for me to run every day.

It is true that runners earn you most but it is such a small difference that is not worth. Also you can see on market that all the cheapest shoes are runners, there is a reason for that. 

Imo, stepn shoud very much consider boosting rewards for runners shoes or remove them fully.

But again if you are some kind of high profile athlete than runners could be good for you. If not than I recommend using them couple of weeks earn some gst and buy walker jogger or trainer(which are most expensive ones).";0;2022-05-18 23:35:27;t3_uspiht;/r/StepN/comments/uspiht/stepn_what_do_you_think_any_good_2nd_purchase/i94z3aa/

350;CryptoMark00;"I think both things are correlated (sneakers and GST). When the GST price starts dropping over the time, sneakers' prices will too. The GST earned by each sneaker &amp; energy is fixed, so if today you're making 15 GST per day, you'll still make 15 GST per day in 6 months; the topic here is that sneakers will be cheaper (due big supply) and GST price will be lower. 
The point here is reach ROI as fast as you can, then you won't have to worry about these stuff.

About Bitcoin, I would not worry much. As you should have seen, despite the recent drop, StepN community and user database did just grow! Right that GST / GMT prices are lower now, but what matters here is StepN adoption in the world.

361;superplexbeats;"In traditional video games, developers nerf certain strategies if they are being exploited too much. The same type of attention is needed for StepN to ensure longevity. The actions in the game need to result in a balance between earning and burning GST / GMT. Later this year, lots of people are going to be leasing shoes - I just hope that being a lessor doesn't become the main meta, otherwise players with a low starting capital are going to be priced out of shoe ownership.

We need the token values to be pretty range bound. If the price rises too much, traders outside of the game will go heavy on shorts. If the price crashes, this will leave a sour taste for players that bought in too high.

I'm interested in what the 'badges' will be used for. In addition to levelling up shoes, maybe you could have a system where you could level up yourself! For example, if your average one mile time improves, maybe they could give you a little boost. If StepN partner up with official race events, maybe they could validate your entry and time, and then reward you based on performance.";0;2022-05-18 18:08:40;t3_usah9u;/r/StepN/comments/usah9u/real_question_as_an_active_user_do_you_think_this/i93ov6q/

366;Vast_Stretch817;"No I don't think GMT can reach that low. It has deflationary properties. Meaning there will never be more tokens in circulation than their initial supply, only less. So if everything goes right and the project develops well then at least it can maintain the current price but if there is demand then it will go up. 
Also take under consideration the liquidity pair which can also have an impact on the price as well as the overall market condition as well.


GST on the other hand has inflationary properties. It has unlimited supply and more GST is minted as you use the STEPN app. It is very hard to guess what will happen but lets use some logic. If there much more daily users of STEPN than now then there will be much more GST minted and put in circulation. Automatically that means the price will go down. 
Also take under consideration the liquidity pair which can also have an impact on the price as well as the overall market condition as well.

387;Imworkingonit94;"Do you mean $1-1.5 per GST? If so then yeah I think you are probably in the right ball park, i‚Äôm a little more bullish and think we have at least the rest of the year at $2.5+ (depending on the state of crypto in general).

The team have mentioned a lot that their #1 priority for Stepn is longevity. To do that they are most likely aware that there must be some level of decent earnings (although decent earnings just depends on where you are in the world).

I think there is massive potential for extra GST sinks as the game increases popular; have mentioned before on here I could see it overtaking apps such as Strava etc. 

With that large a user base tracking and sharing runs etc they could really bring cosmetics into play, that would be a huge token sink and also helps defeat the current Ponzi arguments that the only reason GST/GMT is currently burnt is to create more than the original amount burnt in the future.

The marathon mode, weekly competitions etc also interests me. Will they charge a fee to enter? Could they then burn half the total pot and distribute the rest between the winners? Again that would be huge way to burn on a regular basis and decrease supply.

There are so so many possibilities, this is the best M2E app on the market and the team really seem to care/know what they are talking about; obviously with projects like this unexpected things can happen to ruin it but l think we are in good hands.

404;HomeworkCold3416;"Well I think crypto community is doing a lot of soul searching after Luna's collapse. We are looking at projects with more critical eyes, which is actually good.

Under the current model Stepn is a Ponzi. Reading this reddit, it's obvious most realize it. Those who don't are usually made too euphoric by all the free $ they're receiving and have dreams of that continuing indefinitely.

So under the current model, the only two questions are, how long can it last and how low can the price of gst go? The answer to second question is easy. If there is no influx of new money, the price of gst will be where the price of slp is now.

How long can it last? If you go to any busy area, there are people walking all around you and they could all be running Stepn app in their pocket. The pool of potential users is vast, way bigger than Axie. Stepn could turn into a worldwide phenomenon, or it could never really take off outside the crypto community. 

In the first case, existing users could get multiple x on their initial investment into next year and beyond. In the second case, things could slow down to a crawl already in the next few months and those of us who were buying at the local top (at sol $100) can't hope for much more than getting our investment back, if even.

Unfortunately, we really don't know what will happen.";0;2022-05-18 08:55:18;t3_urx04t;/r/StepN/comments/urx04t/thoughts_on_this_twitter_post/i91wa1r/

432;instrba;I have the same concerns. But there's plenty of free health app out there making money through user counts and ad. While stepn doesn't makes money from ads, it makes it from its tokens transactions. At the moment their in a growth stage and if you can get in and break even, then no risks really. Once they get their leasing options up and running there should be a whole lot of new users who can use the app for health tracking or, if they choose to, get involved in the stepn economy. It's all going to be a balancing challenge for StepnN.;0;2022-05-18 01:07:47;t3_us029c;/r/StepN/comments/us029c/not_my_meme_but_i_thought_this_was_too_funny_not/i90ou27/

442;XSATC;"My thoughts?  You can‚Äôt stop people from saying what‚Äôs on their mind.  So far, the devs for STEPN have been as transparent as possible with keeping some secrets about what‚Äôs to come. Take for example the rent to buy shoe idea, and the analytics they are discussing to make sure people are actually walking/running.  They WANT people to change their lifestyles, and they are trying to make that happen.

Now for my ‚Äúnot financial advice‚Äù segment.  Do I think the returns will stay this high or higher?  No.  You have to remember they are in a public beta.  I expect when they shed the beta tag and for full public, we‚Äôll see it drop.  I‚Äôm guessing probably somewhere between $1-$2 per gst.  I‚Äôm not sure gmt, as the use cases are just coming out on gmt.  The tokenomics are solid, and the team is doing everything to even ‚Äúdumb down‚Äù the language to really be a bridge to web3 &amp; NFT‚Äôs for a public that really knows very little about these things.

My first ever run with StepN got me very little GST too. I recommend you try once more, maybe with you screen turned on, so you can check that you run with right speed and your GPS signal is strong (2-3 stick is ok).

505;mimiguy06;"&gt; I did a test with GMT via Solana network at Binance yesterday and my 2 GMT have not yet arrived on my Stepn wallet. Because of my question, can I use BNB network via Binance to send my GMT?

It's normal, the Solana network is congestioned. The transaction can take 24h or be rejected (and you're refound).

If you send your GMT on BSC (Binance), you will can only buy with BNB. You can't send from Binance Smart Chain to Solana because Solana aren't compatible. The best things, if you wan buy solana sneakers is to try with FTX or other exchange. Because Binance is full since 1 week. Or wait more time and to be patient !

The Stepn team will work on a multi-chain wallet (for make transfert between BSC &amp; SOL), but we need wait a litle bit for having this fabulous functionnality (see the roadmap) : https://stepn.com";0;2022-05-17 14:19:28;t3_urgym8;/r/StepN/comments/urgym8/can_i_use_bnb_network/i8y61m5/

520;The-Consul;Speaking as someone whom is in the digital forensics/ cyber security field and holds crypto, a best practice is to have a individual email account for each platform you use, ie one account for CoinBase and another for STEPN so on.

So 1 SOL swaping to 56 USDC.  if 10% slippage is set; you'd be okay getting anywhere from 51.4 - 60.5 usdc.

If the market is stable, high slippage won't mater, usually SOL is traded under 1% slippage.

At the rate of people joining and the viral part of it will make it sustainable at least this year I belive, maybe even next year. When no more new people joins thats when the prizes on shoes will start to drop. Also if the GST prize would take a huge hit to like 0.5$ that would also send the shoe prizes to the bottom. 

So as long as there is demand, it will be sustainable.

573;JamesIsBest87;The StepN whitepaper goes over all the  basics quite well.  Most questions can be answered with it.  If you have the money and are willing to buy 3 shoes you will start off with 4 energy instead of 2, more upfront cost for bigger long-term gains.  Only 1 shoe needs to be strong, the rest can be just there for energy.  When buying keep the number of mints in mind, if you plan on minting it is better to buy 0-1 mint shoes than those with 2+ mints.  As far as your main shoe, walker is great if you want to just take a leisurely stroll, it has the lowest ROI though.  Runner has the highest ROI of the 3 (trainer can get more but are quite a bit more expensive), but you need to keep up 8+ kmph pace which is difficult for most people.

576;chronosim;"Step 1.
Get a code.

Step 2. 
Get a shoe, a runner.

Step 3.
Start running, while also upgrading the shoe after every run. 

Step 4.
Upgrade it to level 19, because I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôll have some long term success but going straight to lv.30 is too bullish.

Step 5.
Run every day at a park near home, where are no traffic lights and plenty of other people running/jogging.

Step 6.
Lose some motivation when GST goes down by 50% because some president sneezed and it‚Äôs bitcoins fault, but still running almost every day. 

Step 7. 
Get frustrated for not running everyday when the GST goes +145% overnight because user adoption is increasing and rent feature is about to be released. Promise to never miss a day again.

Step 8.
Get injured from running too much. Not real injury, but some pain here and there and it feels like I should rest a bit.

Step 9.
On a rainy morning, while running with pain in my legs and frustrated for dipping often below the 8km/h earning threshold, I get surpassed by another runner. This runner stays alongside, keeping my pace, and asks me ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù. 
I turn to answer, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ rain. But who likes it, right?‚Äù - then I see her, a long lock of wet hair coming out of the side of her hood and a smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually enjoying it‚Äù - she answers - ‚Äúthe smell, the sound of rain, the cold raindrops on my face. It always feels new, fresh, shiny.‚Äù - and she keeps smiling. We chat and I really enjoy the run. My 2 energies are up, but I don‚Äôt mind. After learning that she‚Äôs new in the town, learning about her hobbies and about the fact that her new boss is a bitch, it‚Äôs been more than double my usual runs and I can‚Äôt take a step more. We say goodbye, but agree to meet again on a run, I‚Äôll be running also tomorrow, and the next day, and so on‚Ä¶

Step 10.
Next morning is still gray, but the weather is fine. Will I meet her? Who knows. I ‚Äúcasually‚Äù try my best to be as close to arrive at yesterday‚Äôs hour, and to my surprise, she‚Äôs already there. We run, we chat, it‚Äôs fun. 

Step 11.
We run everyday together. Of course after some time I mention STEPN, I could give her an activation code after all! I don‚Äôt want to sound like a weirdo excited about a Ponzi scheme inviting her to buy a 13 Sol NFT shoe, so I‚Äôm choosing my words carefully. She laughs, but not for the reason I imagined - instead, I discover she‚Äôs already a Stepn user and runs with an uncommon. 

Step 12.
Things evolve. I invite her out and we start dating. The feelings grow fast, very fast - we‚Äôre runners after all. Then it just happens: we mint a shoe together. We‚Äôre both very happy with our mint, we know that it‚Äôll level up to become a great shoe. 

Step 13.
We mint more and both get to 3 shoes. 

Step 14. 
I sell a shoe and upgrade to an uncommon, a jogger, because I can‚Äôt sustain running everyday with 5 energy.

Step 15.
We have different paces, and stuff starts to crumble. We‚Äôre not running together anymore, I‚Äôm way too slow. She can‚Äôt stand her job and she misses her hometown. She also made new friends and I‚Äôm busy too, so suddenly it seems that we‚Äôre not spending any time together. 

Step 16.
We don‚Äôt date anymore. I start flipping shoes and don‚Äôt even bother going to run everyday anymore. 

Step 17.
I see her at the park, again. It‚Äôs evening, I changed my running routine in order to not run into her, and apparently she‚Äôve done the same. ‚Ä¶ why did we break up again? It‚Äôs too stupid, any reason right now didn‚Äôt seem good. I continue running at my pace, she‚Äôs further away. ‚Ä¶ What the hell?! I don‚Äôt care about gst. I start running, FAST. No Gst earned, but I reach her. 
‚ÄúSimona!‚Äù - ‚Äúhey, it‚Äôs you, how are you?‚Äù - that‚Äôs when I realize I don‚Äôt have nothing to say. We‚Äôre not compatible as we‚Äôll never run shoulder to shoulder. My eyes go down, then I see it. It‚Äôs a notification, from CoinMarketCap - ‚ÄúGST -99% in the last hour‚Äù, it says. I look at her and I shout: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre free! We no longer have to run, our shoe difference now means nothing!‚Äù.
Little did I know that every crypto and stock collapsed in a never seen before black swan event.

Step 18.
We marry, mint a couple of kids, sell them on the black market for ~128 sol each.

577;superplexbeats;"I would recommend buying a walker or jogger as a second pair if you do not already have one.

On your rest days, when you don't feel like running, just use the walker / jogger. It may not be optimal but it will be more sustainable in the long run.

If you are a keen runner, I would stick with it. My main pair is a runner and I don't regret it. I've been on a running journey for the past year, gradually improving my fitness and pace, StepN is a great way to keep me accountable. However, after 5 or 6 days in a row of running, I have to get some rest, I will use the walker and accept one day of lower earnings.";0;2022-05-17 00:33:29;t3_ur7nqz;/r/StepN/comments/ur7nqz/my_ego/i8w0vuh/

599;MEPHiSTO6666;Do a run/walk where you use all of your 5 energy in one go or better start when you have the full 5 energy and 15 mins before the next refill so you use up 1.25 energy before it refills (aka ‚Äò125% strategy‚Äô - Google that with STEPN for more details on that). That way you use 6.25 energy in one run. How much energy you use (in one go) has about as much impact on whether or not a MB drops as luck (or possibly more) I use 10 energy with just 11.8 luck and get a mystery box pretty much every time I do that, occasionally with energy usage as low as 5. So using 5-6.25 energy with 18 luck should get you some drops.;0;2022-05-16 18:37:30;t3_ur2h21;/r/StepN/comments/ur2h21/can_anyone_help_me_out_on_loot_boxes_i_obviously/i8uo8y1/

630;Informal_Shelter8033;"Ya I think I can do that... 

Also, here are my thoughts, can you suggest something on this? 

I am looking a best strategy to start Stepn.. me and my gf currently are looking to start Stepn journey I am confused between the following:
Should we both start with a shoes? And level up.. transfer the shoes to 1 account to mint 2 times, after which we both can have 2 shoes each and then finally mint 2 more to reach 3 shoes each?? If soo should we both start with a Level 0 or level 5? 

Also mints? What should we aim for?

ULTIMATE goal is for us to reach 3 shoes each.. 
Again if in future we can mint and flip if we can. 
Currently we can put in about 35 sol. Into stepn (comfortably)

Generally speaking, you should always aim at more energy (if you play long term, for maximum earnings, gems drops, scrolls‚Ä¶) instead of leveling your common to let‚Äôs say 28. Meaning you will mint a lot. 

If you mint consistently you will eventually drop an UC. Most people with 9 ~ 12 energy also buy an UC, since they can afford one after roughly after 2 ~ 3 weeks of earnings. 
It is kind of the natural next step when getting to a certain point. So it is just not worth the ressources to get passed lvl 19. 

Of course, if your goal is to have 4 energy, and just cash out (which I would not recommend, for the sake of the sustainability of STEPN, and for your sake as you will miss out on many aspect of the game) then you should lvl it up to 28 as it will give you more tokens per run.";0;2022-05-15 20:46:45;t3_uq7k4h;/r/StepN/comments/uq7k4h/which_slots_for_gems_r_better_eeee_or_eeer_please/i8qlw5u/

I think they have not thought the rental system through yet, it seems that the owners assume all risks - including renters not using shoe, costs, fees - for just 70% of income - and keeping mystery boxes, which is actually likely to cost you, lol. So does not seem to make much sense from owners perspective, especially for good shoes. Of course makes ton of sense from the StepN point of view, the reason they propose 1 day up to 7 days max rentals is prolly to have extra fees from transferring shoes back and forth etc. Renters will only risk their rating which is not much/anything  in the beginning, they can always start a new account ...;0;2022-05-15 18:44:47;t3_uq8ndr;/r/StepN/comments/uq8ndr/in_the_future_why_would_anyone_rent_a_common/i8q5cyk/

691;Forsaken_Shopping902;"Hmmm stepn is not a gamble.

And you clearly didn't understand my point.

If you are a logical person would you invest in a negative expected return over a positive expected return?

At this point, luck is a meaningless stat that Stepn created.

**That is why a Comfort gem is more expensive than a luck gem.**

&amp;#x200B;

If luck is solely created for a gamble . Luck shouldn't be a stat. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you still don't get it. I would like to ask a question.  

Have you found anyone who investing in luck stat to get a mystery box? I assume no because it is better to invest in efficiency and resilience.

&amp;#x200B;

If your concept is right(luck is a gamble that returns a negative expected return) Stepn spent a meaningless hour on a luck system because logical person would not choose over a positive expected return over a negative expected return.";0;2022-05-15 08:50:14;t3_uq0o8b;/r/StepN/comments/uq0o8b/i_feel_like_its_not_worth_to_open_mystery_box/i8oc4lq/

14 to 21 are 2 durability per energy --&gt; 1.2 per 0.6 rounded down to 1.

Solana doesn‚Äôt have a native Stablecoin on its blockchain which is why STEPN has USDC within the app which is a multi-chain stablecoin.

937;McMafkees;"&gt;I'm being as bullish as I can

Word of advice from someone who's been in crypto for 5 years now: do not be as bullish as you can, especially not when the market is uncertain. The current market eats people with this mindset for breakfast. Remember that even a solid project like Eth went from $1400 to $80 before it reached $4700.

I love Stepn and I'm using it every day. I think it's a very smart project with active devs who've put a lot of thought in creating a viable economy. But still, the issue is that the rewards of Stepn are highly market dependent. We've seen the rewards dropping like a brick the past week. In the summer of 2018, markets went down for 7 months in a row. Currently, we've only had a 2nd bearish month. There might be a lot more to come, especially seeing how the crypto market becomes more correlated to other markets which are also getting increasingly uncertain. I don't mean to be negative, I just want you to keep a cool head and to also take bearish scenario's in consideration. And for the love of god, stop taking out loans to enter the crypto market.";0;2022-05-13 08:50:47;t3_uocnwn;/r/StepN/comments/uocnwn/my_game_plan/i8fgsaf/

991;K0Schinck;"Energy spent is solely based on time. Personally I've uses StepN often when doing quick errands and pause everytime I go into a shop and unpause once I'm out. Haven't seen any reduced in income, but you do have to pause-unpause frequently so it could become annoying but not impossible

I didn't see any penalty, but it will often put me in ""Moonwalking"" for the first few seconds after unpausing, done too frequently on a short run, I could see this as detrimental on your potential income. 

In my case I'll often have 5min walk then pause for the red light, then unpause. Few seconds every 5min is marginal, but I would assume that pausing every minute could have a much important impact.";0;2022-05-12 19:57:15;t3_uo6wzh;/r/StepN/comments/uo6wzh/best_sneaker_for_disc_golf/i8d024a/
992;kmamidala;"No problem. You probably could. I doubt the app cares about 5 second pauses. The minimum on a walker shoe is 1 km/hr, which is pretty glacial, so I think you'll be ok. If you have a tricky putt or something you can tap the pause button.  
Where I am there is no way you can play a course without waiting behind approximately 8 million people and their strollers, even at 10am on a Tuesday morning :)

  
Sometimes I'll go out in my tiny backyard and garden and turn on Stepn. I don't earn as much that way, and pause it every once in a while when I'm stationary, and the app doesn't really seem to care.   


Another thing to keep in mind is your energy allowance. With one shoe you only get 2 energy (10 minutes) unless you spring for an Uncommon, which adds 1 energy.   
I think for disc golf, you're probably going to want to get to three shoes so you can get the 4 energy (20 minutes). So maybe buying a cheap shoe to try it out and make sure you can earn, and then adding another cheap shoe and minting for three, is your best bet.  
Let me know how it goes, I'm very curious and I hope it works for you :)";0;2022-05-12 19:46:53;t3_uo6wzh;/r/StepN/comments/uo6wzh/best_sneaker_for_disc_golf/i8cyf3g/

1001;kmamidala;"I am very familiar with disc golf. The one thing you need to know about Stepn in a disc golf context is that you will need to pause the app every time you're not walking, which could become a pain in the ass. When you're throwing, waiting for the next hole, searching for a disc, waiting for others to throw, etc.   
The reason for this is if you fall out of the optimal speed range (when you're stopped, for example) it still uses energy but you're not getting any GST, and they have an algorithm that will actually penalize your earnings if this happens too often or your average speed is too low.  
Also, I don't know if you can pause a walk a bunch of times without penalty.

  
In your position, I would get a cheap low-level walker shoe, experiment with it using stepn,guide to see how much you should be making, and compare your earnings. If it ends up  working out you can buy another shoe to mint with, or sell the original shoe and get something better.";0;2022-05-12 19:01:04;t3_uo6wzh;/r/StepN/comments/uo6wzh/best_sneaker_for_disc_golf/i8cr9df/

1016;Fuddemy;"I think this StepN has a future for sure. If I didn't belive that I'd sell my shoes now and keep my money on the side forwhen we find the market bottom. 

Of course that's just my opinion and I base that and the projects uniqueness. You know this when loads of copycat scam projects copy paste a good idea.

I think it's a good time for newbies to start this as the shoes are cheaper at the moment because of the price of Sol. 

But people have lost a decent amount of their portfolio of late with potentially more to follow, so the risk is always there. That's being said, getting in now is cheaper than before and is a great time to buy floor price sneakers and level them up yourself with your earning with GST being also down with the rest of the market.

The win here is when the market recovers you'll be earning a higher amount of GST. This means you could return your investment and keep your shoes for passive income and use that return to get some sale price blue chip crypto during the accumulation phase in 2023.

This all hangs on StepN surviving the bear market along with countless other projects.

There's no guarantees in this space but I belive this is one that could change lives both in your health and in your pocket.";0;2022-05-12 16:37:36;t3_uo3g3g;/r/StepN/comments/uo3g3g/i_have_a_really_important_question_and_looking/i8c5msp/

But of course crypto can get worse from here, maybe we haven't seen the bottom yet. You gotta ask yourself if you want to get your ROI asap or u are fine with a nice passive income, semi slow. I'm in the latter group so not worried too much, all my Stepn income goes to Eth anyway and since everything is down, it's all the same to me.

1029;MomentGlittering4527;Like every crypto project it is self sustained. Tokens are generated by walking/running and burnt when levelling, repairing or minting. The goal is to have as much tokens burnt as possible for the best GST price. If u are new to crypto - this is basically how almost every project works, especially p2e.

So to transfer SOL, you definitely need a Phantom wallet. You will need SOL to pay for gas fee, so do not convert all your SOL to USDC. Binance transfer of SOL are extremely confectioned at the moment, just be patient.

1042;scenia;"Actually, the deceptive thing is looking at USD value. Imagine it was reversed, with crypto values rising like crazy. You could invest into stepn (let's say you bought X SOL for $1000, then put that into stepn), get a 10% ROI in SOL within a week, then cash out. At that point, if the value of SOL is 10 times what it was when you started, you'd have ""made back your investment"" if you look at USD value. But the truth is, you'd still only have made back 10% of your investment into stepn, while your investment into SOL increased tenfold. In that scenario, if you hadn't invested into stepn, you'd be sitting at $10k instead, so if you compare that to the $1000 you'd have instead, your actual ROI is still 10%.

In the current situation, imagine you made back your SOL investment into stepn in 25 days, but SOL was down 50%. Looking at USD value, you'd only be at 50% ROI, but the crucial thing is if you hadn't invested into stepn, you'd be sitting at the same amount of SOL, so the actual ROI from stepn is in fact 100%.

Bottom line, if you invest into something using currency X, but track your ROI in currency C, you're really mingling the ROI of the investment with the ROI of the currency exchange, making neither visible. The investment could be great and the currency could be doing terrible, or vice-versa, or both could be stagnating, but you couldn't tell the difference of you only looked at the combined ROI.";0;2022-05-12 12:04:05;t3_unqsod;/r/StepN/comments/unqsod/friendly_reminder/i8b36se/

1050;rr7241;"It's fake :)

If you look at the webpage and compare it to STEPN, it really is way too simple and basic to be legit. But let me point out some red flags here:

* There's no clear and verifiable link to Asics as a company.
* Social link at the top are only pointing to [twitter.com](https://twitter.com) and [discord.com](https://discord.com), not to any real profile page.
* The number of minted shoes keeps rapidly increasing and this is done to put pressure: mint at this ridiculously low price because they're going fast !! But if you look at the JavaScript bundled inside this page, you will find that there's this function

`const Ki = setInterval(function () {`  
`if (+Ti.innerHTML &gt;= 3252) clearInterval(Ki);`  
`else {`  
`const t = Math.floor(4 * Math.random() + 2),`  
`e = +Ti.innerHTML + t;`  
`localStorage.setItem(""amount_stepn"", e), (Ti.innerHTML = e), (Ui.value = e);`  
`}`  
`}, 3e3);`

which generates a new random number and sums that to the starting one every 3 seconds and stops as soon as it reaches 3252, because they still want your money ;) If you reload the page the counter will be consistent, giving you the false hope that it is indeed legit, but again it's just smokes and mirrors: they persist the current number on the localStorage. If you simply log in with another browser, you will see different numbers.

`window.addEventListener(""load"", async () =&gt; {`  
`Li.parentElement.removeChild(Li),`  
`null !== localStorage.getItem(""amount_stepn"")`  
`? ((Ui.value = localStorage.getItem(""amount_stepn"")), (Ti.innerHTML = localStorage.getItem(""amount_stepn"")))`  
`: (localStorage.setItem(""amount_stepn"", 2431), (Ti.innerHTML = 2431), (Ui.value = localStorage.getItem(""amount_stepn""))),`  
`(document.querySelector("".mint-price"").innerHTML = ""2 ""),`  
`(Oi.innerHTML = \`TOTAL: &lt;span class=""total""&gt;${2 * Pi.value}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=""currency""&gt; SOL.&lt;/span&gt;\`);`  
`});`

Every time you access from a new browser (or you clear the local storage for this page) the counter will always start at 2431.

* The website itself is served through HTTPS and the certificate is issued by LetsEncrypt so it only means the connection is encrypted.
* If you run a quick whois against the domain, it will show that it's been created 2 days ago by a private person from Russia.

1.Select proper  hain at receiving and sending address.As here sending chin is solana so you need to choose solana network in binance also.for example this case you want to send to bianance- You need to click deposit button,select usdc,in drop down chain selection  choose solana network and copy address.That address you need to paste in your stepn wallet.
2.Make cross check  your deposit address are same.
3.Always send test amount like 1 or 2 usdc or what ever suit to you to loose.

Why wouldn't it be against their policy to give them away then? If someone does a walk and gets energy from it, why does a stepn user need more than 1 code? people are generous enough to give them away, but then there's that side of people who will sell them for crazy amounts and people will get scammed often. I really, really want to make something from my time spent on making the accounts. I am not doing anything malicious and I dont plan to scam anybody, I actually plan to grow this if i can see this going in a good way. I really dont want to stop here because a few people downvoted my post and think I am a ''scammer''. If anybody understands me, I hope they do. The amount of people who give codes away are smaller than the amount that are scamming/doing other types of dumb stuff with what they earned from it. People posting on my subreddits a code for other people to use, but it's like 1 freaking code and I have 20 something accounts ready to sell. You dont see that this can help people?  


Oh and peep this, I'm not selling codes, I'm selling already activated accounts.

Nobody has to worry about getting banned because STEPN won't even be aware that somebody on their app is doing something wrong.

1107;Particular_Pickle798;"Hello mate, sure I can probably help a little with your questions.

1. As you said, can be predicted, but what I am sure of is that the current price of shoes is way below what it was a couple weeks ago. It already big sales. I would get as fast as possible since STEPN is about your account‚Äôs growth that takes times. 

2. First, choose your type of shoes that suits your speed best. If you can run for an hour above 8km/h, everyday then pick a runner. If that is not the case definitely pick a jogger / walker.

For any person starting this game. They should look at the same thing in a pair: efficiency and resilience between 6 ~ 7 to 10

Since you‚Äôre telling me you are here for the long run, I assume you mint a lot to extend your energies. Therefore, buy a pair that has 0/7 mints. Very important. 

Since you will be minting (breeding 2 parents sneakers to get a new one) you should also look at the sockets (the 4 locks around the sneaker). Try to find, on top of all the above, a pair that have 2 E at least, with R if possible. Best would be 3 E and 1 R. 

3. Once you get your first pair, level it up to 9 first. It will take you 45 hours. Now you should earn (if your pair is good) between 10 ~ 13 GST / day. The long term strategy is to cumulate these GST to the point where you can buy a second 0/7 mint pair (depending on the GST price, it could take a month). When choosing your second pair, find a pair that has the same E sockets as your main as it will boost the chance for your new pair to inherit this E sockets. 

Once you have these 2 pairs, earn enough GST (roughly 20 days) to mint your third pair. When it is minted. You will have 4 energies and earn double GST. Now you goal is to farm 6 more pairs to get to 9. Once again, if you are looking at long term, good account. 

After this you can come back to me and I‚Äôll explain the minting strategy that will allow you to mint a lot quicker from from 3 pairs to 9 then 9 to 12. 

Hope it helped üëç of course, by reading the white paper, you will get 80% of all you need to know. So make sure to read it on their official website.";0;2022-05-12 02:01:26;t3_un9tah;/r/StepN/comments/un9tah/what_is_happening_guys_is_stepn_is_safe_or_not/i89le0f/

1149;macsoft123;"&gt; even if you put the 13 sol back today you don't end up on the same amount

Nope. I get exactly the same amount: 13 SOL. And thats how you do Crypto. 1 SOL = 1 SOL every time. 

""You could have sold those 13 sol.."" could of should of would of... I could of done a lot of things with those SOL, But i'm a SOL HODLer, so no. I wouldn't have sold it.

Some day I will sell that SOL at the top to get more BTC. so STILL not comparing it to the $. 

1st Rule of investment: if you invest in $ you ROI in $. if you invest in EURO you ROI in EURO. if you invest in BTC you ROI in BTC, and if I invest in SOL I ROI in SOL. 

If you think in terms of $ that invested in STEPN, are you thinking you could of converted that $ to OIL and had much more profit? So do you ROI thinking in the price of OIL? thats you ""opportunity cost""

1158;Chooky47;"Thanks for the shoutout!! 

I‚Äôll list some basic tips I found handy to know, excuse the length! But this will give you some good info! 

- Sneakers cost GST, which is the local token, to level up. You get 4 points to allocate per level for a common, and once they are applied you can‚Äôt move them (at the moment). 
- When you buy a sneaker, you want to aim for as high an efficiency and resilience stats as possible. 
- if you buy one with the points already allocated (shown by green on the bar for that stat), you can‚Äôt change it. If they‚Äôve wasted points on luck and comfort, don‚Äôt buy. 
- efficiency (how much GST you earn) and resilience (the repair costs) are important for making the best returns at the start, that‚Äôs your focus! 
- luck earns you mystery boxes which have gems, but you can only earn them if you have 4 energy or more (math reasons) so luck isn‚Äôt really important at first. Comfort is only for max level shoes / also not important for you now 
- base stats for common shoes are out of 10, aim for a minimum 5 efficiency and resilience 
- you get 2 energy at first for owning a shoe. 1 energy = 5 mins. It replenishes 25% every 6 hours. After getting a shoe, there‚Äôs a 24 hour cool down to start getting energy (to prevent shoe sharing). 
- if you own 3 shoes, you get upgraded to 4 energy. Uncommon shoes are hard to get and are expensive, but give you 1 extra energy too. 
- you have to repair your shoes each run, I recommend getting your shoes to 10 resilience, as resilience works in ‚Äòblocks‚Äô so it changes at 6 and again at 10. Moving from 7-8 for example, does nothing. 
- getting shoe to level 9 to begin with is good, because level 10 costs a lot more to upgrade, so many people stay at 9 unless they want to push more profit. 19 is the best cost efficient level and tops 9, if you want to push to it eventually. 
- if a shoe falls below 50/100 durability, it will earn less. I repair after each run, seems easier to manage. 
- you need SOL in your wallets in the app to make transfers. So you‚Äôll need to send SOL to STEPN first. You get SOL on a crypto exchange such as Binance or coin base. After that you can fiddle with stuff, but that‚Äôs the first step, sol is having some delays so be mindful of that - and send a tester amount first to make sure you‚Äôve done it right. Use the solana network for transfer when asked. 
- once you‚Äôre in, go to settings and profile, and make a password with your email. Handy to have if they update and you need to sign in - last time people got locked out cause it was jammed trying to send out emails for authentication.
- four shoe types. Walkers are a slow walk and earn the least, joggers are a normal/power walk and earn middle, and runners are a jog and beyond and earn the most. See how you go for pace! Trainers can go any pace, but they are expensive. 

Hope this all helps! Sorry for the length, just wanted to make sure I covered everything! Let me know how you go! Here to help if needed.";0;2022-05-11 20:14:58;t3_un6r56;/r/StepN/comments/un6r56/where_to_start_zero_to_hero/i889n5q/

1172;Sergio_Andre;"You‚Äôll never get your assets back. Look bellow for STEPN announcement:

**ANNOUNCEMENT:** 

Hello @everyone . 

Here's a quick update regarding the MISSING ASSETS - CRITICAL CASES. (This is specifically for people who have had missing assets for 7 days or more, and have filled my Google form (https://forms.gle/44n52w9sSoYk3ZXL8). 

The form has received 839 responses so far, yet despite this number, I quickly noticed that a lot of the submissions are **UNRESOLVABLE** missing asset claims. 

**RESOLVABLE MISSING ASSETS:**
=====================================
**Generally, these are cases where assets were lost due to stuck/pending/delayed transactions.** This includes: 
üîπBuying/selling in the marketplace or in Magic Eden
üîπTransferring to/from wallet to wallet
üîπTransferring to/from the Spending account
üîπMinting when there was a network or node issue

These activities leave a trace of where the assets went, so we can trace and try to retrieve from there. 

**UNRESOLVABLE MISSING ASSETS:**
=====================================

1Ô∏è‚É£**LOGGED INTO THE WRONG STEPN ACCOUNT.** Member reports getting logged out during maintenance/update. The member tries to re-login, and see an empty inventory. **We can't resolve this because the resolution is to log in with the right email address.** The telltale signs of an incorrectly signed into account are: 
üî∏you got logged out due to maintenance/update. 
üî∏you check the run history under profile &gt; total distance, and the run history is zero, even if you've ran using STEPN in the past.
üî∏you have given away activation codes in the past, but don't have any used codes in the activation code section.
üî∏the email address you have logged in with has ZERO verification code requests from the past. 

2Ô∏è‚É£**ACCOUNT TAKEOVER (HACKING).** The situations vary, but the telltale signs of a hacked account are: 
üî∏you are logged out in the middle of an activity, such as walking or jogging, and there IS NO MAINTENANCE/UPDATE going on. 
üî∏there are verification code requests in your inbox that you did not request for.
üî∏someone has requested your verification code/seed phrase via DM in any social media channel, or even via call. 
üî∏you remember going to a website where you were asked to log in using your STEPN email address, and/or asked for your seed phrase. 

3Ô∏è‚É£**INVALID REPORTS.** Members responded to the form even though their assets were missing for only a few hours/for less than 5 days; members are reporting a non-missing item issue; member's response is unclear; member's details are lacking. **These submissions will be de-prioritized** over those with complete/clear missing asset issues that are older than 7 days.  

There are a few other missing asset reports that do not fall into any of these categories, and I'm still crunching the numbers. Will update here once I have a clearer picture.";0;2022-05-11 17:38:26;t3_uneifn;/r/StepN/comments/uneifn/how_did_i_lose_all_my_shoes_in_stepn/i87lq0p/

1177;kmamidala;"With transfer speeds varying wildly, it can be hard to respond quickly to the changing market and random Stepn announcements.  
A couple of things I've done to help myself-

1) Keep some coins in your spending and wallet, whatever is appropriate for your strategy. I keep GST and GMT in spending and some SOL in wallet, because I'm leveling up and minting shoes. If you're buying shoes, you'd keep some SOL in spending. I know nothing about USDC. 

2) Try different means of transfer to the app.   
Yesterday I was trying to send SOL from Coinbase (which has worked the last three weeks) and it wouldn't go through. So I bought GST on Coinbase and sent it instead, and it went through immediately (but this hasn't worked in the last three weeks)  
Always send a small test amount first, of course. 

3) Screenshot before and after confirmations of every transaction always. If shit goes wrong you have clear proof that you can submit to the support team (and peace of mind for you)

4) These things will help you be more patient during the beta phase's growing pains. And again, always test with a small amount before you send more.";0;2022-05-11 17:00:51;t3_un5nyr;/r/StepN/comments/un5nyr/are_transfers_always_slow/i87fwai/

The minute I started this post, I got some DMs accusing me of disrespecting the project and trying to convince me its a very secure and decenterlized project, so I shouldn't just ""hit and run"". 

So I don't know how much longer STEPN will allow this post here, as it seams teaching people to get a fast ROI is not good for there business.

1204;macsoft123;"It depends on your concept of ROI. The best mindset in crypto is to compare altcoins to your strong coins, instead of USD. 

Like I don't care about LTC/USDT for example, but I do care about LTC/BTC for example.

So if I invested 13 SOL, and I believe in SOL, my ROI is when I get 13 SOL back. no matter how much 1 SOL is worth in USD now or then when I invested it in STEPN. So you best timing for for trading GST for SOL is when the chart (comparison) GST/SOL is high. If you trade on those highs, you'll get more SOL for your GST each time.  

So since there is no native GST/SOL chart on tradingview, you have to insert the above formula so you can get a GST/SOL comparison chart. if you trade GST for SOL each time the 1h chart is overbought, you are always getting more SOL for your GST each time. 

So after this drop we've had on BTC dragging all alts went down, we are still comparing GST to SOL and not GST to USD. the GST/SOL comparison chart just got a spike last hour, and that was a greart place to trade GST for SOL";0;2022-05-11 14:16:04;t3_una1ru;/r/StepN/comments/una1ru/got_my_only_shoe_14_days_ago_got_roi_today/i86qo5p/

1223;Orihisoy;"Welcome to Stepn! I suggest you try using the app without getting a sneaker first - just to kinda understand how it functions and get a sensing of how fast you can actually walk comfortably.

If you are able to walk comfortably at 4km/h (i.e. without it turning into a jog), then go for Joggers; otherwise, Walkers.

1) Go to marketplace and filter accordingly to sneaker type.

2) Filter level and mint according to your preference. Without going into too much details, a lv5 with mint 2 or 3 is a good place to start.
(Note: I personally recommend buying a lv19 if you have the budget for it. I believe the premium is worth it.)

3) Browse and look for sneakers with base stats of Efficiency + Resilience &gt; 12. To check base stats, click on the 'Base' button. You want to prioritise getting a sneaker with high efficiency.

4) Luck and Comfort are good to have, but not necessary for your first pair. Same goes for sockets. I personally believe there are many opportunities to upgrade along your journey (if you ever start minting, you'll understand why).

That's it, really. Just take note that transferring SOL between the wallets can take a while, so make sure you have your SOLs before you browse the market place.";0;2022-05-11 11:51:36;t3_un7j3i;/r/StepN/comments/un7j3i/what_to_look_at/i868b5z/

1276;move2earnphysio;"**Today is talking all about ankle stability and how to avoid twisting your ankle**  
  
It is one of the most common injuries in the world. Most people have twisted their ankle at some point and could have challenges with ankle stability.  
  
Once you do it once, it is much more likely to happen again.. and again.. and again..  
  
Building up strength in the foot, ankle, leg and hip is key to avoiding future injury.  
  
Balance is also key to injury prevention.  
  
To train balance, just like strength, you need to gradually progress it.  
  
You can do that by:  
\- Changing to softer surfaces  
\- Moving your other limbs, drawing alphabet with your leg or juggling with your arms  
\- Moving your eyes around - works well to watch the balls you are juggling  
\- Closing your eyes  
\- Adding cognitive load - e.g. counting backwards by 7s from 100  
  
**If you are getting value out of what I am doing, consider donating GST, GMT or Sol to Cwu2WA6y86zxiL2XLwbxVHpn7R3vBs1tK3pQcXJYwctt**

1294;SliceOfHumboldt;"I'm in the US and not a tax expert but as far as I understand it and based on information from my accountant any time that you earn cryptocurrency (as apposed to buying it) that is considered income. Then when you sell it you are supposed to pay capital gains taxes if the price you sell at is higher than the price you receive it. Aside from the appreciation or depreciation of the GST and GMT earned in the game there is also the value of the NFT's (sneakers, shoeboxes and gems) to consider. For example if you sell a pair of sneakers for more than you bought them for I believe that would technically be subject to capital gains taxes. Here is a list of the taxable events related to StepN as I see it. 

\-Using Solana to buy sneakers, sneaker boxes or gems - subject to capital gains tax

\-Earning GST and GMT - taxed as ordinary income

\-Using (burning) GST and GMT - subject to capital gains tax

\-Receiving gems or GST from mystery boxes - taxed as ordinary income

\-Selling sneakers - subject to capital gains

\-Minting new sneakers - taxed as ordinary income

\-Trading any in game asset for any other in game asset - subject to capital gains

\-Selling any Solana, GST or GMT that is transferred out to exchanges - subject to capital gains  

Many of these are happening every day, multiple times a day and for some high level users most or all of them could be happening every day, multiple times a day. As you can imagine, keeping track of all these transactions and the price or value of each asset at the time of the event would be difficult if not impossible. 

If anyone would like to try this spreadsheet could be helpful.

1326;Dan_gig;"Shoes do cost less rn because SOLs value is decreased so the shoe has gone to it's floor price but you also get the advantage of SOL being cheaper. So you'll get a shoe for a less amount as a result of both of them going lower because of the crypto market taking a hit. 

In that case the problem you will face is that the SOL that you will get after selling won't be of the same value as the SOL you used to buy the shoe initially. So yeah you can say in SOL it might be lesser in value but the Shoe price on the Stepn Marketplace will be more or less the floor price itself (unless there's like a crazier meltdown ofc).";0;2022-05-10 16:21:57;t3_uminfo;/r/StepN/comments/uminfo/stepn_beginner/i82gc7h/

Or did they not check the latest price at the moment of that post? 

I don‚Äôt know, but in any case, I‚Äôd go with the general guidance that they posted. I don‚Äôt think that will change for awhile. And as far as the mechanics of how they will change the minting cost, I‚Äôm not sure. Arguments can be made for both cases. One can argue that the prices will automatically change and that‚Äôs why they gave us the GST price formulas beforehand so we are not confused. Or one can argue that even with that general guidance, they would still give us periodic announcements of changing prices.

1419;Big-Community-8710;"We've got 2 tokens GST and GMT, where the second one is the governance token. Your earning potential GST to GMT is 20:1. Eventually GST will drop a lot in value and GMT will raise, then many people would prefer to earn GMT.

Once when we've got this clear, to the second part. GMT market cap is around 2 bn and its tradable on the exchanges. Considering the marketing potential and the hype around this project its safe to assume that some big investors will pay attention and trade the token heavily to keep the price fair and somehow stable. 

The GMT daily cap is 15 tokens per day (MAX), so most likely you'll earn 1-2 GMT per day and we as a community wont be able to affect the price that much in the beginning.

This project could easily last a few years and get tens of millions members. The only issues are that they need to constantly bring more new members to offset the selling pressure and the other issue is that crypto is cyclical (when is dead-its dead)

1439;Shikaka62;"Any play to earn crypto essentially is a pyramid scheme. STEPN itself openly says this.
Returns are based on acquiring a steady stream of new users and current ones reinvesting their earnings.

Now are STEPNs tokenonmics strong enough to consistently award people the same amounts long term as we have been accustomed to? Probably not, but they‚Äôre the first to tap the retail/non crypto crowd with their product which in turn gives access to huge amounts of liquidity.

If they continue to build and develop more burn mechanisms, then there‚Äôs no reason to believe to think we‚Äôll have a sudden crash like you see with other NFT projects in the short term as there is still such a huge demand from new users.

1491;hearsdemons;"1. Don‚Äôt use the Stepn app functionalities to send Sol from Binance to Stepn. Go to the Stepn wallet and copy your address. Now go to your Binance account then paste that  Stepn address to your Binance withdrawal. 

Couple of noteworthy points about transfers. Don‚Äôt send too much at first. Send a single or fraction of Sol to make sure it is going to your stepn account correctly. Secondly, solana can at times be congested or shutdown. It can take hours or even until the next day before you receive your Sol into stepn. Once your Sol arrives at Stepn, you will need to send it from your Stepn wallet to your stepn spending wallet to be able to buy shoes with it. Again, sending things between your Stepn can be anywhere from instantaneous to several hour wait time. 

2. The cheapest shoe is about 13-14 sol. Make sure that the shoe your buying fits your lifestyle workout. Walkers make the least amount of money but are the easiest to use daily, runners make the most money but you will have to run at a high speed every day or else you won‚Äôt get laid. Joggers are the happy medium. Also, you want the base stats of the shoe to be good (at least 5 in both efficiency and resilience). Ideally, you want the efficiency to be 7-10 and resiliency to be 5-10. The other two stats don‚Äôt matter to you daily gst earnings. 

3. Make sure you get a ledger as soon as you can. And once you start getting paid daily and you choose to cash out instead of leveling up your shoes, that you send it to your ledger cold wallet. Don‚Äôt share your email, password or Stepn seed phrase.";0;2022-05-09 00:44:30;t3_ulf6ay;/r/StepN/comments/ulf6ay/woohoo_just_got_my_code_few_questions/i7v3jme/

My shoe reached level 10 today, and I upped my Resilience to 11.5. Now my durability cost is 1 instead of 2 for each 0.5 energy (actually 0.6), 3 minute walk. Following [stepn.guide](https://stepn.guide) would have kept me at 10.5 for several more levels before going to 14.5.

I only have one shoe so I can't confidently say that the threshold is definitely at 11 Resilience for all cases, but I've read several discussions that confirm/suggest it to be the case. The below link is a recent one:

1552;Tough_Leg_2001;"IMO they are searching to satisfy everyone, in this order :
- big first investors (GMT burning IG)
- the stepn company (highest transaction fees and royalties)
- the ecosystem (preventing high volatility by making IG functionnality hardest to accomplish)
- the newcomers (keeping floor price around psychological roofs, like 1k$)
- the actual players (keep an 'acceptable' daily income, to prevent massive cashout)

If I were them, that's what I'd do :
- harder mint (not more expensive, but harder). It seems that the scolls system is related to that.
- using GMT only for lvl up.
- 25% more for the cost repair.
- 0.5 gst or 0.1 GMT for transfer from spending to wallet.
- 6 sneakers = 6 energy
- increase loot crate rate for 4 energy or less
- burning GMT for a random perk (+2 energy for 1 week, +10 eff for a month ...)";0;2022-05-08 15:20:23;t3_ukw1g5;/r/StepN/comments/ukw1g5/there_will_be_new_rules_anyone_has_an_idea_what/i7t0kni/

1571;freak_0o;"Mich w√ºrde auch interessieren ob da jemand von euch schon mit einem Experten gesprochen hat. Sofern ich das bis jetzt richtig verstanden habe, dann muss man auch ganz klar zwischen Staking und Mining unterscheiden. Aber die aktuelle Rechtsprechung kann bei weitem noch nicht mit der sehr dynamischen Entwicklungen im Crypto-Space Schritt halten

Nach der aktuellen Einsch√§tzung im Netz handelt es sich beim Mining um eine gewerbliche T√§tigkeit, da hier **nachhaltig**, **selbstst√§ndig** und mit **Gewinnabsicht** gehandelt wird - [Besteuerung Mining](https://www.winheller.com/bankrecht-finanzrecht/bitcointrading/bitcoinundsteuer/besteuerung-mining.html)

Beim Staking kann das Prinzip der **Selbstst√§ndigkeit** zumindest angezweifelt werden, was wiederum gegen eine gewerbliche T√§tigkeit spricht - [Besteuerung Staking](https://www.winheller.com/bankrecht-finanzrecht/bitcointrading/bitcoinundsteuer/besteuerung-von-staking.html)

Um was handelt es sich jetzt bei StepN? An dem Punkt bin ich auch √ºberfragt - ich w√ºrde hier aber eher Richtung Mining tendieren. Durch den Kauf des NFT's kann man nachhaltig und selbstst√§ndig GST erlangen, damit d√ºrften alle Voraussetzungen f√ºr eine gewerbliche T√§tigkeit erf√ºllt sein. Aber evtl. kann hier ja jemand mit Fachwissen weiterhelfen.

Aber ungeachtet ob eine gewerbliche T√§tigkeit vorliegt oder nicht, nach meinem Verst√§ndnis m√ºssen trotzdem alle Transaktionen dokumentiert werden. Und jeder verdiente GST muss als Einkommen mit dem Zeitwert in der Steuererkl√§rung deklariert werden.";0;2022-05-08 10:50:48;t3_ukx955;/r/StepN/comments/ukx955/taxes/i7s87k7/

I have repeatedly received a verification code to my email address. 15 verification codes were sent in a row, then I entered the stepn application and tried to change my password. But the app did not connect me, I tried again and again. Then I went into the app and there are no shoes. Looks like all my assets have been sold. Solana Fee is not in the account. Someone may have hacked my account and sold the shoes and withdrawn them to their own address. I had trainer level 5 shoes with id #941564299. Before this happened I had 0 solano in my spending account and shoes in my account. He is no longer in the shoe spending account and has 0.16 fades. Someone hacked my account, sold my shoes and took the money. He linked the money or shoes to my account in his own wallet and uploaded his address and sold the shoe or money to that address. Because there is no exit money transaction in my wallet. I beg you help! It had been 1 day since I entered the system and deposited the shoe money. Unfortunately I'm done. If a new wallet other than my wallet was connected to my account, he stole my shoes and money. I don't know how, there is a huge security hole and it happened to me in just one day. If I had sold the Shoe, the money would have been in my wallet. Please examine my account in detail, you will see how it is. Someone entered my account without my knowledge or bought shoes or sold shoes in the market, tied their own wallet and took the money from that wallet, this is my money.

1596;yonks;"üåü NEW FROM THE CREATORS OF STEPN (AMA - MAY 7, 2021)  üåü 

‚ö° In the near future, according to the creators of STEPN, a balance will be established between the prices in the Solana and BSC networks in the game. More people are migrating to BSC soon. They believe that many more sneakers will be minted soon on the BCS network even without additional events.

‚öôÔ∏è The team has worked on improving transactions. Worked out the dynamics of Nodes. The system is now fully operational. The speed of transactions between Spending and Wallet has increased.

‚ö° Genesis owners in the BSC network (*sneakers with numbers from 10,001 - 20,000) will also be rewarded in the future.

üêº A new design of Panda sneakers is coming soon. It will only be available in May. The ability to crush this can be obtained by burning gems. This design will not provide in-game benefits other than beauty, collectibility, and rarity. In the future there will be sneakers with other animals.

üî• The game will introduce the mechanic of burning sneakers to get a sneaker with improved performance. It will be possible in this way to create the ‚Äúperfect sneaker‚Äù.

‚ö° The next update of the application will be a transitional step to the public version. The game will have new rules.

‚öôÔ∏è So far, there is no mechanic in the game that keeps track of who exactly walks / runs with the phone. But it will definitely be added in the future.

‚ö° App update coming next week.

üìú A new NFT is coming to the game!
The Mint Scroll can be obtained in the game as a drop at the end of the walk. It will be necessary, for example, for mint Common and Uncommon sneakers. The Luck will not affect its loss. Only the amount of energy spent for 1 walk. This innovation is aimed at combating ""farms"" that only deal in mint.

ü™ô There are no plans to make a bridge between GST on Solana and Banance in the game yet. But technically it can be done. It will probably appear when GST prices are equal in 2 networks.

‚ö° According to the creators of STEPN, Trainers earn randomly between Runners and Walkers. But Barndog (the game's Australian ambassador) claims that Coaches earn more than runners, or the same, based on aggregate statistics.

ü™ô GMT can be transferred in the game from one network to another.

ü™ô STEPN cannot prevent the GST token from being listed on exchanges.

ü™ô Over 60 million GMT have already been burned. About 3-6 million tons of fire are burned per day.

‚ö° New filters in the store in the application will appear no earlier than June.

‚ö° STEPN employs more than 100 people.

‚ö° Phase IV in the game will last 2 months.

‚öôÔ∏è The game already has a mechanic that will not allow 1 person to earn for 1 walk with 2 phones at the same time. At the same time, the mechanics do not affect the earnings of 2 people walking nearby.

‚öôÔ∏è Transaction log will appear in Spending soon.

1600;fatbutbald;"When using 0.5 energy you actually get 0.6 energy, giving you extra GST. 

Here is how I do it: Refill times for me is 08:00, 14:00, 20:00 and 02:00.

I chose to run 08:00 and 20:00, so when I want to start this strategy I use up all my energy at 20:00. Then watch some movies and go to bed.

At 02:00 I get 0.5 energy, but I just keep on sleeping. 

At 07:30 I wake up, get a coffee and 07:50 I put on my shoes, go outside and start Stepn app. I still have that 0.5 energy from 02:00, so I run until it's gone. Takes 3-4 minutes. 

Time is now  07:58 and I'm out of energy. So I stop stepn app and close it, and catch my breath for 2 minutes. 

Time is now 08:00 so I open my Stepn app and see that I have another 0.5 energy in there, so I run until it's gone.

Then in the evening I do the same, (but might have some beer instead of coffee) üòé

This strategy let's me use a total of 2.4 energy instead of 2.0. Repairs are a bit more expensive (8 units instead of 5) but I net between 1-1.5 GST extra per day. (Level 9 jogger, should give about 12.31 GST with two energy according to stepn.guide but gives about 13,5 - 14 with the 0.5 energy strategy)

BUT I AM ALSO OLD AND TIRED, so sometimes I oversleep and miss my morning thing. Perhaps I wake up at 12 (with 1 energy already in my account). So do I panic and start running using up my 1.0 (bonus free) energy? Nope. I wait until 14:00 when I get another 0.5 energy, so that I have a total of 1.5 energy. Because 1.5 energy is counted at 1.6 so I get that extra bonus 0.1 energy. So THEN I go running, right? Nope. I wait until 19:45 and THEN I go running spending my 1.6 energy BEFORE the refill at 20:00

At 19:57 I'm all out of breath, so I stop and close stepn app and rest for three minutes.

Time is now 20:00 and I have 0.5 new energy that I use, and get paid for 0.6

So I slept in, ran only once (in the evening when it's less hot), got to take a break, and used and extra 0.2 GST, netting me av extra 0.70GST compared with running it in one go with 2.0.

Gst is 5 usd at the moment

With 1 pair of shoe 2 energy the reward is 10gst so 50 dollars daily

1625;Big-Community-8710;"Eventually the GST price will drop and GMT price will rise. The ratio between both tokens considering the potential earnings is 20:1. Eventually devs will tilt the project more towards GMT use case.

GMT has a daily cap of 15 tokens per day, while GST has 300 tokens daily cap. Again over time GST will drop significantly and more people will try to get to the highest levels and opt in for GMT earnings. The ROI will decrease also, therefore its good that we are on board early

For example when GST drops below 1$ and GMT is trading above 15$, Instead of making 40 GST per day, you'll prefer to get 3 GMT per day.

GMT market cap is massive and the daily traded volume is more than 1 bn while GST is sitting at around 50 million. Theres a many big whales trading GMT daily and you can assume that we cant affect the price that much while earning a few tokens per day.

The Stepn team is well aware of this and quite active pushing the GMT token instead. It's usecases will increased in the next months (for example paying GMT to reallocate the upgrade points).

EVEN IF I spent some of my GST on leveling up buying more shoes, and only got back *half* of my initial investment, there is still a health benefit, and I say this as a fat lazy guy that just lays on the sofa all day, 

Stepn has made me go out EVERY SINGLE DAY, most days twice to walk/jog, in +35¬∞C. I think that the health benefit /lifestyle change that 4 months of daily exercising does is worth 9 SOL on its own, probably more! 

If stepn stopped working today, I would still be 98% more likely to keep walking 10 minutes every day than I was before. And if Stepn was still around, but had a 90% drop in GST rewards, I could still walk myself into getting a free weekly beer. üòÅ

1684;hearsdemons;Yeah any other exchange that carries Sol will work. Personally, I‚Äôve shed Binance and Kucoin to connect to Stepn.

Kucoin is a little more relaxed but keep in mind, Kucoin is in Asia so there will be some hefty foreign transaction fees, around 3% I think of your transaction amount.;0;2022-05-07 16:05:26;t3_ukf01r;/r/StepN/comments/ukf01r/beginners_guide_to_stepn/i7ovf10/

1690;Overall-Butterfly331;"Long term I don't see it as a Ponzi and here's why: 

I initially dismissed Stepn because I thought the buy in was too high, then realized I'm an idiot because I walk everyday anyway, for free.  If I can invest some money up front to monetize daily walks for what I hope is at least the next year or two then why the hell not?   
I know the time will come when I'll only make a few bucks but that doesn't matter to me, I'll still be out there walking everyday.  There are millions of people who do the same thing, walking or running is a daily habit already so Stepn is just fun and not intended as another degen play. 

Once earnings go down dramatically this will be the core group who continues to use the app and will be a great demo for marketers IMO.  I was a massage therapist for 12 years and in my experience people who run everyday tend to be affluent.  These users will need real sneakers, are willing to invest in their health and have disposable income. 

Yes I can understand why people see it as a Ponzi short term especially if they aren't people who already have a daily habit of walking or running, IMHO.";0;2022-05-07 15:32:16;t3_ukdzbs;/r/StepN/comments/ukdzbs/prove_me_wrong_stepn_is_a_dialed_down_ponzi/i7oqycr/

The nice thing is stepn can actually pivot to a different business model/concept once that happens, unlike, say, bored apes, which are bound to the raw ""buy this because it's art"" concept.

1694;Crypto4Canadians;"I agree with you about the idea of STEPN potentially being a Ponzi. However, here are some other factors to consider:   


1) of the pool of users, how many people can actually exercise daily and meet the energy requirements?   


2) if all people do is cash out, wouldn't that just drive down GST price to a new equilibrium?  


3) The way I see STEPN is like this: 100 people pool in $100 and thus you've got $10,000 in the pool. Based on how much you exercise in relative terms to the other 99 people  is how much you'll make. Thus, the more you've run compared to others the more you'll make while others will lose money. In some sense it's like an indirect bet against others on how much you can exercise relative to them. I could be wrong about this idea though.";0;2022-05-07 15:18:52;t3_ukdzbs;/r/StepN/comments/ukdzbs/prove_me_wrong_stepn_is_a_dialed_down_ponzi/i7op6b2/

1696;scenia;"Stepn actually doesn't strictly require new members to work. Since the tokens and NFTs are freely tradable on the open market, money can enter the system through the medium of demand (and thus appreciation) on the secondary market. While this essentially just shifts the blame onto the crypto/NFT market, it means stepn isn't inherently any more of a Ponzi than crypto and NFTs in general.

Now there's a very strong argument for NFTs specifically being an elaborate Ponzi scheme, and I agree with it, but as a previous commenter pointed out, our entire economic system is technically a Ponzi scheme with extra steps, so yeah...

It should be noted that with leasing on the horizon, there's actually a planned feature that entirely removes the buy-in requirement, which would instantly collapse a classic Ponzi scheme. But since stepn is only a Ponzi to the extent that the market as a whole is one, this ends up being fine. Do expect prices to tank rather massively once that releases, though. We'll experience a partial collapse then, and anyone who joined shortly before will need quite some time to break even. But there's no inherent reason they can't break even at some point.";0;2022-05-07 15:02:07;t3_ukdzbs;/r/StepN/comments/ukdzbs/prove_me_wrong_stepn_is_a_dialed_down_ponzi/i7omyq6/

The later you are in the game, the higher the chances for you to actually loose money from a potential crash. You need to catch the train at the right time in order to make the $$$. So far Stepn looks like it's in the right phase for someone to buy and possibly make some extra money from it by just running. Not sure for how long though.;0;2022-05-07 12:46:04;t3_ujxihr;/r/StepN/comments/ujxihr/stepn_is_a_ponzi_scheme_the_same_way_any_stock_or/i7o6s2i/

Cheers.";0;2022-05-07 12:45:03;t3_uk4xsz;/r/StepN/comments/uk4xsz/is_it_worth_investing_in_stepn/i7o6obd/
1711;Particular_Pickle798;"I don‚Äôt want to sound rude but, you should definitely not invest in any project without doing your research right. 
GST and GMT are the tokens of STEPN. This is how you earn money. The in game coins if you prefer.

Not knowing about GST yet thinking about investing in STEPN is quite scary‚Ä¶ 

As a general advice: don‚Äôt just invest in projects because everybody talk about it, or because you saw some hype. Luckily STEPN is a legit, good project. 99% of crypto project don‚Äôt succeed, and most of them are scams too. 

So please, go on official websites, read white papers, check their communication channels (discord, Twitter) look at the community there. 
Then, ask around questions, like you just did. 

Most people won‚Äôt help you because you did not even made your own research.

1713;TheScienceBoy;"I was wondering about this today too. I think it's to do with daily cost in durability.

As you level past a certain threshold for Resilience (around 12, according to what you say), you only lose 4 durability instead of 5, for each daily allocation of 2 energy.

When you split your walks into four 0.5 energy sessions, you lose 2 durability with each walk instead of the loss of  5 durability from one long 10 minute walk. Totals a loss of 8 durability for the day. I've confirmed this myself.

But, according to what you've described, when you've leveled up Resilience to the point where you'd lose only 4 durability per day, it seems each 0.5 energy walk only costs you 1 durability.

I think the StepN guide calculations are based on doing the walk in one hit and doesn't take into account splitting the energy into multiple sessions per day.

I'd be interested to see more detailed analyses if you have any. :-)";0;2022-05-07 12:13:10;t3_ukbjfy;/r/StepN/comments/ukbjfy/stepnguide_calculators_not_always_right_heres_the/i7o3ie9/
1714;hearsdemons;"We are well aware of the delicate nature of designing a robust, thriving economy. As STEPN explodes in popularity, we‚Äôre quickly becoming a virtual country ourselves. That comes with all the complexities of designing a monetary policy for a country in real life.
That‚Äôs why we look to examples of who have come before us ‚Äî even real-world historical examples, such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis ‚Äî and carefully study ways to avoid economic meltdowns. In the play-to-earn space, this sort of hyperinflation, which leads to a ‚Äúdoom cycle‚Äù of asset devaluation, has already occurred several times.
The most prominent example is Axie Infinity, which saw the price of SLP, its in-game currency, plunge over 90% in the past several months.
Axie has pioneered the play-to-earn space and paved the way for all other x-to-earn startups. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs facing inflation challenges now, driven by the fact that more players are cashing out their SLP rather than reinvesting them. With insufficient demand, the token is expectedly depreciating, which drives even more players to cash out into more lucrative stores of value. As a result, mass capital flight ensues.
So how are we setting ourselves apart?
For one, we‚Äôve been diligent in designing the game to be inherently fun and positively addicting. And we encourage users who are there to, not just earn tokens and NFT rewards, but strengthen their relationships within their communities (walking together and leveling up sneakers together).
This presents a hedge against those who are only walking to earn as much as they can and then cash out their earnings (which drives inflation). In other words, we‚Äôre ensuring a vast majority of the STEPN community aren‚Äôt just here for cash ‚Äî they are here for all the other intangibles ‚Äî better health, better relationships, and better mood.
Secondly, we have plans to roll out features beyond just breeding, repairing, or upgrading sneakers that will address the delicacy of move-to-earn tokenomics. The GMT token, for example, will also be used as a way for users to vote on donating to carbon offsetting programs and we plan to integrate social-fi elements that go beyond move-to-earn, adding more value to GMT and building in more robust use cases for the token. And we‚Äôve also built in key incentives, known as ‚Äúgame sinks,‚Äù for users to retain their assets and continue to reinvest in the game.";0;2022-05-07 12:06:37;t3_ukanve;/r/StepN/comments/ukanve/highly_recommend_reading_this/i7o2w98/
1715;Particular_Pickle798;"First and foremost, investing in crypto always has a certain lvl of risk. M2E is difficult since it is easily compared to (often rightfully) as a Ponzi. 

Now, I am 12 pairs in, earning good money everyday (350$/day) I could cash out but the game is so well done that I keep reinvesting in it. 
Minting more shoes to get rarer pairs, upgrading my gems to boost stats, building a GMT farmer and a MB farmer‚Ä¶ and not all the features are out yet. 

I participate in every AMA‚Äôs and events online. The founders are very aware of what they are doing. They have analyzed previous m2e and p2e. They are fully invested in the project. They personally answer the community‚Äôs questions. They choose amazing ambassadors. And they react very quickly to situation that could harm the sustainability of STEPN. 

For sure, earnings will drop in the future. GST was not meant to make you earn so much. So current players are benefiting from this. But even if GST drops at 2$, 1$. With GMT pumped by many burning mechanisms. It would be a great investment. Much better than any other NFT projects you see out there and more reassuring than just coins trading.

1721;Particular_Pickle798;"When I say 3$ is what the community think would be the right price. Nobody knows what GST price will be. Only the future. 

To answer your question.

Price drops, mint price also drops. So it cost you less to create shoe right. Now, nobody will sell a shoe at a price lower than the mint price. Otherwise you are at loss. 

This is why floor price always change according to GST price. But selling shoes is not the way you make income in STEPN. It is by running.

There will also be renting in place later this year. So that will provide new users the ability to play the game without making big purchases. This will also pay users with extra sneakers a passive income. 

My point is this is a developing space. There are new ways of cash entering into the company.

1769;StannisW;"You're wrong, though. The issue STEPN has is that the amount of sneakers in circulation is uncapped and also growing by more and more as time go on. This means that once the growth of new players hits a plateau, earnings will collapse because new sneakers are minted and there's not enough people to buy them.

Compare this with a stock, say a subscription business. If you have one million subscribers to your subscription business, that's a profitable business even if the number of users stay that way for the next year straight. It can even decline. STEPN can't do this without it resulting in total collapse.

1772;Alroyloggins;"Agree with your theory. Every user is focused on the daily earnings and should instead be thinking about selling their shoes while there‚Äôs still a market for them. 

I like Stepn but breeding is a problem. the sheer number of sneakers that will eventually be in the market will diminish their value. If every user can breed then the potential supply is infinite. Eventually supply will be far greater than demand. People will have spent time and money investing in their shoes but they will only be worth what someone is willing to pay for them. The more shoes in the market the more difficult it‚Äôll be to sell and that will lead to a reduction in sneaker prices.

If you‚Äôre in early enough you‚Äôll probably be fine but I wouldn‚Äôt be basing my investment strategy on the thought that the sneakers will continue to increase in value.

I bought my first walker on April 1st. I got my ROI on the 20th of April and got my second walker same day.  Exactly 10 days after on the 1st of May I got my 3rd Walker. Apart from my initial investment on the 1st of April, I haven't brought in anymore money to STEPN. 
From the foregoing, does it look like I have doubled my investment or taken profit?
My 1st walker is @lvl 12, 2nd @ lvl 9 and 3rd @ lvl 8. 
My first walker was bought @ 11.88 SOL then SOL was @ $135.
All 3 walkers cost me less than 35 SOL. 
Current valuation of my first walker alone is more than 40 SOL put conservatively.
Remember what I said  earlier, it's all about strategies.
Talking about taking profits, after my 3rd walker and the leveling, I have thus far accumulated 5 SOL and 70 GST since May 1st between the 3 sneakers.";0;2022-05-06 19:44:31;t3_ujskry;/r/StepN/comments/ujskry/has_anyone_taken_any_actual_profit/i7ld1b3/

[https://stepn-calculator.netlify.app/](https://stepn-calculator.netlify.app/)  


but: 

plan A: Mining: 

the cost of leveling up your runners to 5 and them minting right now is 12.12 sol /and you will probably get another runner which you don't want. So you have to sell it on the market and the floor price for a 0 mint runner right now is 14 sol. then there is %6 tax so you will have around 13.1 sol. A 2 mint jogger floor price is around 12.5 sol. so you will be +0.6 sol.

Assuming you want to pay for minting cost using your earning and again assuming you are making around 20 gst daily with 3 sneakers, that will take you around 10 days to cover the cost. ( with gst and sol prices right now) 

but now you have 1 more mint with the minimum cost. 

Plan B: Getting from market: 

the floor price for a 2 mint jogger is around 12.5 sol which again assuming you are earning 20 gst daily, it will take 10 days for you to cover the cost. 

The decision is yours to make.

1801;MEPHiSTO6666;"I would say even if people burn all the GST they have earned in the app and the supply goes down as a result that doesn't necessarily  change the price. Its supply and demand as you say so only if people on some exchange where GST is listed now (like FTX) buy it for speculative reasons (most likely because they don't know enough about STEPN and the tokenomics - because if they are bullish on the project they would buy GMT) or if STEPN users sell SOL or USDC to buy GST as minting is attractive it goes up. If people cash out the GST they have earned vs. SOL or USDC then GST will go lower.  
If demand for shoes holds up into a GST drop then minting becomes more profitable (as the cost to mint goes down while sneaker prices stay the same) which should lead to people buying GST to mint or at least stop to sell the GST they have earned).

Worst case is that sneaker prices and GST both drop so there is no supply from minting and everyone just sells.

Later in the game GST will be supported by GMT. If GMT is worth more than GST and people can earn GMT they will level up to L30 (and burn both GST and GMT in the process) and then switch to GMT earnings and therefore reduce GST supply.

so the Devs put a number of balancing mechanics in the game but in the long run people need to keep buying sneakers  and spend GST (and GMT) in the app rather than cashing out otherwise there will be more and more GST tokens and no buyers of them so the price will drop";0;2022-05-06 16:29:19;t3_ujl0zj;/r/StepN/comments/ujl0zj/can_anyone_eli5_what_causes_the_gst_prices_to/i7km21x/

1857;kmamidala;"No problem!   
There do seem to be a lot of weirdos and scammers swirling around this project- but honestly, I've seen that with many projects, especially new ones. I think this one might be attracting more than its share of scammers because it's the first major one in the FitFi/ Move2Earn space, and the thieves want a piece.  
People's sneakers and accounts being hacked is awful, although we don't know the whole story. Did they click on a suspicious link in an email? Freak out and try to contact the nonexistent ""chat support""? Minding their own business and super unlucky?   
I personally haven't experienced this and my heart breaks for those who have gotten hacked or scammed. I imagine there will be more transparency down the road regarding the shoe wallets and whatnot.  
Transferring SOL from Coinbase to my Phantom wallet (Ledger backed) takes about a minute, and then same to Stepn. It's been really fast for me.  


Leveling does take time. 60 minutes per level. That is, going from 0 to 1st level costs 1 GST and takes 60 minutes, going from 1 to 2 costs 2 GST and takes 120 minutes, and so on. Level 5 costs both GST and GMT, as does Level 10.   


You cannot use your shoe while it is leveling. It is best to do this immediately after your run/walk. You can level a shoe to 5 in one day if you start when you wake up and have the GST.";0;2022-05-05 23:47:33;t3_uj42ei;/r/StepN/comments/uj42ei/before_you_ask_for_a_code/i7hpr8e/

1861;Fine_distinction;"Great to hear, thanks! I am a bit worried that things seem to be done in a black box in the off-chain StepN wallet - I always imagined that it will be on a blockchain, that we could sea every transaction etc.

I love the concept, but I am worried about putting any serious money into it - there is a ton of reports of things missing from people's account and the number of scammers around the project is terrifying, never have seen anything like that. That's why this email-code wallet seems such a bad idea, they could use 2FA apps on the phone. 

What do you think of numerous report of people being hacked? the only good think about hacking steps account is that NFTs don't have values beyond the system, so hopefully devs will help resolve that? and coins we can keep in a proper wallet.

Thank you very much for explaining how the things works, I assumed that now that GST and GMTs are listed, will be easier to buy them directly on the exchanges, but will do what you recommend.

How long it typically takes for SOL bought on Coinbase or Kraker to arrive in your wallet and then in StepN spending?

1865;kmamidala;"1) When you trade in the app, it will give you an estimate of how many X you are getting for your proposed sum. I have checked these figures in more than 10 transactions and found the value/price to be exactly the same as the one in the Coinbase market at the exact moment.  
I'm not trying to shit on Coinbase, I can only tell you I have waited days to send GST or GMT only to have it never reach its destination and refunded to my account (after I filled out a support ticket.) As I said, they will fix this (or perhaps they have already) so always test with a very small amount.

2 &amp; 3) I honestly don't know. These are good questions. I imagine at some point the devs will address them given the amount of money people are investing.

4) I don't know Solana very well. My experience on the Solana end of Stepn (once the SOL went from CB to Phantom) was pretty quick and easy. I haven't had any of the problems other users discussed. Perhaps I'm just lucky. I have done 30+ transactions into and within the app, own 10 shoes, and have never experienced more than a 5 minute delay.

1866;Vegimzh;"Dear StepN,  
  
I know that you are going through a lot of emails and requests.  
  
I have already sent this problem to your technical team, but since I have no feedback, I have no choice. I have worked so much to buy and upgrade the sneaker, I have upgraded it to the 14th level, and it was already in the value of 2500$.   
Two days ago, while I was asleep, there were three emails with the confirmation codes sent by your team and the verification process had to be done in 10 minutes. Since I was asleep, I noticed the e-mail in the morning, and I did not enter with the code you provided, but I used my password that I always use for the application. But when I entered, GST token was OK, but there was NO Sneaker and no wallet. After a while I retrieved my wallet using the seed phrase, and it was Ok with the assets I already had, but I don't know what happened with the Sneaker?

1868;Fine_distinction;"Thanks, very good explanations! I am familiar with crypto, but not Solana.

When you trade GST inside of a STEPN wallet, can you approve the rate? or just click convert and get whatever system will get you? especially with current volatility and potentially low liquidity at times, I was thinking that using a highly liquid exchange like Coinbase would be better. And Coinbase clearly can clearly receive GSTs ok, that how they started trading them.

wrt the code, I worry about bots, not sure if they can operate on a phone, but on a computer, knowing somebody's email, it is super easy to break a 6 digit code.

Do we know if there are bots in STEPN? eg selling and buying bots? I never kept anything valuable on a phone, so was not researching how easy is to automatically trying to break passwords on an iPhone app.

You seem to know Solana very well - do you think it will be able to withstand traffic if STEPN will become as popular as we hope? or can they just add another chain, like BSC, for example Polygon? current situation is worrisome with items often disappearing and users having 'items lost in transaction"" for days, devs even created on discord a special ticket for people who cannot recover their assets for more than 5 days .. and Solana's very low costs may not be such a blessing, with DoS attacks and network spamming";0;2022-05-05 21:55:18;t3_uj42ei;/r/StepN/comments/uj42ei/before_you_ask_for_a_code/i7hazpo/

1870;kmamidala;"1) Phantom wallet is a well-known Solana wallet and easy to use.  
2) I have had nothing but problems trying to transfer GMT or GST I purchased on Coinbase  to my Phantom wallet or Stepn wallet directly. I assume this will eventually be fixed, but proceed with caution. SOL from Coinbase seems to have none of these issues. \*Disclaimer- I always transfer SOL from Coinbase to my Phantom wallet and from there to Stepn  


1) Not sure. Your phone should be on a 1 or 2 minute password protect anyways.  
2) Screenshot every day and every transaction. No exceptions.  
3) It is highly doubtful someone can guess your 6-digit passcode  
4) I don't know  
5) As other users have pointed out, most 2FA is a code sent to your phone, which would be pointless if your phone was compromised. Sending to email might be a little better, but this presumes you are next to your computer when you want to use Stepn.";0;2022-05-05 21:43:14;t3_uj42ei;/r/StepN/comments/uj42ei/before_you_ask_for_a_code/i7h9b7y/

If you have 2 uncommons, it‚Äôs almost certain that you will have another uncommon after minting (but there is a rare chance that you will have a tier down or tier up sneaker (a common with bad luck, or a rare with good luck).

1885;Exotic-Caterpillar70;"You need to value the fact that you can level three sneakers at the same time.  This has significant value...if you focus on leveling all the sneakers up at the same time then you will have three high-performing shoes in a couple weeks that will perform at 6 energy vs 4 energy.  I believe this to be most profitable if you have the risk tolerance to be a long-term holder.  

I've correlated this to a game of digital real estate that incentivizes you to put capital back into the deal to generate higher returns at a later date.  This is not exactly apples to apples but it plays out like this.  The sneaker is the house/the NFT is the land, GST is the bank, offering debt and interest, GMT is equity.  Solana is the dollar that buys the house.  If you level up the sneaker (pay GST), you are paying off the principal of the loan that you borrowed from the bank.  Now if you get an interest free loan (ie don't level up your sneaker) then yes in the short term you will cash flow nicely, but you are not building equity in the house unless the market has no inventory.  This is not California 2022, this is California 1849.   
Since we know there is a lot more housing supply (shoes) to hit the market, the price of sneakers will stay somewhat stable as they slowly introduce demand and counter any supply imbalance with minting events.  I believe we can estimate where we are on total shoe supply by the amount of GMT that has been released into the market.  When you get to level 30 GST earnings turn into GMT, which is like saying your house is now paid off, now you are in the equity.  If the ratio of equity (GMT) to debt (GST) gets out of whack, ""the fed"" or stepn in this case will put in temporary policies to help the economics to stabilize and not throw us into a recession.  Minting or ""wear and tear"" leads to the depreciation of the asset.  Just like in Monopoly, the goal is to own as much real estate as possible.  I believe Stepn is building towards that in their rental model.  Just like someone who owns a lot of rental properties, the goal is to create passive income/mailbox money.  Now some people will say but you earn GST, how is that debt.  Well GST is like the money you're borrowing from the bank to get the shoe up in value.  You have to constantly spend it to increase your position, similarly you constantly spend money on your mortgage to pay down the principle.  And every once in a while you make capital improvements, new roof, paint, etc (ie spend GMT, equity) that is required at leveling up during level 5, level 10, etc.  Oh and isn't it interesting that the price of GMT and GST has been floating around the 35%/65%  ratio lately?  This is a typical equity to debt relationship on your basic commercial real estate deal.

I've thought about this too much.  I really enjoy the game theory.";0;2022-05-05 17:29:37;t3_uivqj1;/r/StepN/comments/uivqj1/you_are_allowed_to_use_multiple_accounts/i7g7qn3/

You can definitely set an account for your wife. You may either transfer you Sneaker or purchase a Sneaker from the Marketplace to get her started. If you are worried on the possibility of account sanctions due to the fact that you and your wife walk together, please note that as long as you have individual accounts and using different devices, it will not be counted as multi-accounting.
 
I hope this clarifies! Should you have any questions, please feel free to let us know.
 
Kind regards,
Maria

Hi (my email;-),
 
Thank you for reaching out to STEPN Customer Support. Let me help out! 
 
I understand that you want your wife to have her own account.
 
You can definitely set an account for your wife. You may either transfer you Sneaker or purchase a Sneaker from the Marketplace to get her started. If you are worried on the possibility of account sanctions due to the fact that you and your wife walk together, please note that as long as you have individual accounts and using different devices, it will not be counted as multi-accounting.
 
I hope this clarifies! Should you have any questions, please feel free to let us know.
 
Kind regards,
Maria

When it comes to the actual training she would follow her normal training regimen. The StepN rewards would come secondary and just be an added incentive for something she‚Äôs doing anyway.

2106;hearsdemons;"I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think anyone knows. Let‚Äôs just go off what we do know. 

1. Stepn has 2 coins, GST and GMT. GMT is capped at 6 billion coins and GST is unlimited. Long term, this means GMT will be more valuable over the long term. 

2. Stepn has first movers advantage is this space. It‚Äôs the first major move to earn crypto project that has reached this much success or scale. We‚Äôre at 300k members and still growing by the day. This means even if other move to earn projects come along, it‚Äôll be unlikely that they‚Äôll be as big or successful as stepn. Which means stepn could be here to stay for a long time. 

3. The most comparable project to Stepn, in recent years, is Pok√©mon Go. Pok√©mon Go has 81 million active monthly users and 8 million active daily users, and has managed to stay alive for 6+ years now. 

4. The difference between stepn and Pok√©mon go is that with stepn, people‚Äôs initial investment is on the line. If we‚Äôre assuming the 300k members as of now each have at least 1 shoe to play the game, and the cheapest shoe costs $1,200, that‚Äôs $360 million locked up in the game just from people starting out in the game. All of those people will almost certainly continuing playing until at least their initial investment is returned. That creates a cycle of 1-3 months just for everyone to get their investment back. Which means there will be a lot of active users for at least the next 3 months for anyone who‚Äôs just starting out now.

5. If Pok√©mon go did 6 years when no money was involved, Stepn can do at least that when people‚Äôs incentive is that they will be paid. 

6. No one knows what will happen to GST. What we do know is that developers are very keen that GST doesn‚Äôt get too high so that the game stays beginner friendly. GST is being kept cheap, and with the minting, shoes are being kept cheap, so everything costs next to nothing for someone just starting out. Because the devs are very hands on with changing the rules of the game to not allow a coin to skyrocket, I don‚Äôt see GST going above $10. GMT on the other hand is limited supply so I see that going higher than $10 long term.";0;2022-05-03 18:47:08;t3_uhm4zr;/r/StepN/comments/uhm4zr/gst_to_120_by_2024/i76zifa/

2114;voraciousrunnig;"Yeah, she runs track and xc so it definitely becomes a gray area. I thought maybe there was some flexibility with NIL guidelines too, but it really doesn't seem like apples to apples. The M2E is available to anyone who joins, and it's not like StepN would be using my daughter's name for any promotions(although great suggestion about StepN endorsements). Your example also brings up another potential issue. I can see a football player being able to use this no problem since running isn't related to their sport. But would this qualify as being compensated for performance given a track/xc athlete primarily runs?

2138;CallItNothing;"Hi! My name is Taylor, and I recently got involved in STEPN because a friend actually mentioned it to me. 

I would be farther along, but since I‚Äôm a runner and got so excited when he first told me, I tried to figure it out on my own that night and ended up losing over $4k to a scammer that privately messaged me in Telegram. 

It was my fault. I should have known better. 

Anyways, it looks like I‚Äôm set up to buy my third sneaker at the beginning of next week, which will give me four total energy. 

I am trying to get to nine sneakers as quickly as possible because I have no problem running 6miles daily. 

Long story short, I‚Äôm wanting to know if you‚Äôre familiar with a way to boost my energy before I actually get to 9 energy. It seems like the only way would be if someone loaned me sneakers to get me to 9 energy and I paid them a percentage of my daily GST earnings until I minted up to 9 sneakers, myself. 

The issue with that, of course, is there are so many scammers and it would be incredibly risky, understandably, for someone to loan another person sneakers that they met over the internet. That being said, I‚Äôm very trustworthy and obviously not a scammer. Are you familiar with any way where I could connect with people who could verify I‚Äôm a real, trustworthy person who runs a lot? It just seems silly not to earn for 45min or 60min each day, when I CAN actually run that long and someone else might just have sneakers in their wallet that they can loan to earn some passive GST. My thinking is that with each new sneaker I mint, I send back a sneaker to whomever loaned me one. 

Just to reiterate, I‚Äôm not a scammer; if you feel uneasy about responding, please feel free to ignore this message. I just happened to have this Reddit thread show up in my inbox, and I figured it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to send a message. 

I don‚Äôt need an activation code, obviously, as I‚Äôm already part of STEPN and have two sneakers. Please feel free to reach out if any of this sounds interesting. I‚Äôd be willing to send a picture of my ID or anything to verify who I am. 

Like, on one hand, it seems silly not to partner up, but on the other, given the nature of crypto and te fact that someone would basically be transferring/loaning $6k of assets (6 sneakers) to someone and it being completely up to the person they are sending them to to be trustworthy, pay the percentage of GST AND send the sneakers back, I completely understand why it doesn‚Äôt happen. 

It just seems like it would help both parties a lot, should they trust each other because the game is set up in a way where, say you have between 15 and 30 sneakers, the extras after 15 aren‚Äôt really being utilized until you reach the next energy threshold. 

My friend did this with me - he loaned me two sneakers for me to have in addition to my one, so I could earn GST faster to mint a second sneaker using mine and one of his. I paid him 25% of my GST earnings while I had his sneakers. He just needed his back though because he reached a new energy threshold. 

Anyways, if anyone is interested, please let me know. Again, I was hesitant to post this because of all the scamming going on, but I figured it was worth a shot, given that I am not trying to take advantage of anyone. It just seems like a potential win-win situation.

Got paid as a pitcher, but could play college football since he didn't make money playing football.  Very odd.  But, this was before NIL so things have changed.

2163;move2earnphysio;"Yep!

It's completely fair enough that people are getting excited about the app and all the earning potential. But, that will only be feasible if people take looking after themselves seriously. 

There are very valid arguments for the positive effect an app like this could have on global health, but musculoskeletal injuries are a major burden on global health too. As is made very clear by the issues with opioid pain-killer addiction around the world. 

Most of that is due to inactivity, but one reason people become inactive is they go down a spiral of injury, initiated by doing too much too soon and developing a bad association with exercise. 

There are biologically set adaptation periods for different tissue types (muscle adapts faster than bone, cartilage, ligaments etc) and you just ignore that unless you want to end up injured. Particularly for people who have done very little running in their life and/or are on the older side. 

I do like how the app has built in ways of making it progressive by limiting energy for new users. But, if you go all in, especially on a runner, it could get pretty unsustainable for most people. 

Anyway, I hope that all the people getting into STEPN and move to earn take this seriously because if they do, it will be a great thing for individuals and for global health.";0;2022-05-03 10:17:57;t3_uh8ltp;/r/StepN/comments/uh8ltp/i_am_a_marathon_running_physiotherapist_and_i/i754lyk/

And to read at the same time, between 2 lines of the discord chat, those who are looking for a code, or who only have one shoe and are a bit stucked.  
Some showing their pharaonic gains, others in total disarray to enter the game.  
FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)  
I was like many, simply falling into FOMO.  
Mixed with a bit of shameful envy.  
And for me those feelings are a nightmare.  
My goal is to be able to walk 1h to 1h30 a day.  
I know in my heart the path to follow.  
Everyone should have a goal, a path.  
YOU should.  
Staying calm, making decisions carefully.  
The rest doesn‚Äôt matter.  
Never forget to stay yourself, always keep your values in mind¬†!  
First STEP(N) to JOMO¬†? (Joy of missing out?)

At least watch some TA of Solana while your at it. It's in the downtrend as well, went as low as 82 yesterday due to the shutdown again.

1-2 more shutdowns in the bearmarket and not even  StepN can help holding the SOL price up.

TA suggest all the way down to 30 SOL.

2188;SwissPrivateWanker;"StepN is built using the Solana chain, that chain has received the most amount of FUD in the entire eco-system and yet is still leading and comfortably behind the third crypto in use if you remove the cash products like USDT, USDC and BNB. XRP is ahead today, but that's a weak chain and only ahead due to Solana experiencing an outage yesterday.

Long story short - a guy called Algo likely is long algorand which is a subpar chain compared to Solana - he is butt hurt that a game like STEP'N is doing so well. You cannot judge STEP'N yet, it might collapse if there is not enough consumer of the game and only profit maximizers - or it might become a global phenomenon that will make LoL look like a joke.

2205;Equal_Ad1759;"I've noticed that exchange rates are better on the stepn app than on exchanges, at least for gst to usdc. 
After playing around for a few hours yesterday, my flow is now (I use phantom but any other solana wallet should work):
1. Convert gst to usdc in stepn
2. Satoshi test (send small amount to make sure funds arrive and you're not stuck waiting anxiously for hours) USDC from stepn to phantom
3. Deposit from phantom to binance (make sure you have at least 0.01 SOL for gas in phantom + chose the SOL network when extracting the binance wallet address)
4. Optional: move funds to any other defi/exchange where you can stake your usdc

Notes:
- You could also just send the sol/gst to phantom and convert on any other decentralized exchange that supports gst - e.g. raydium (more likely for conversion to work right away, but slightly lower rate, at least for gst/usdc on raydium yesterday)
- I prefer usdc to sol, as sol has been going down lately. Depends on whethere you're willing to bet on sol or usdc (or gst for that matter)";0;2022-05-03 06:30:29;t3_ugk937;/r/StepN/comments/ugk937/whats_the_best_way_to_take_profit_gst_gmt/i74oout/

I started with 3 shoes and knew I wanted to mint and sell them to return some of the capital I put in.

I like StepN so I went to 9 Shoes - minted 2.   I have sold 3 sneakers so far and pulled out $3k of the $12.4k I have put in.   Getting ready to mint more and sell them.

I mint and take them to lv 5 and mint again selling the one that is 1 Mint.

You can either stay at 1 shoe and just walk or get into it if you want or have the $$.

You can get 3 shoes - mint and walk longer if you want.  I would sell the 1 mints and upgrade new shoe to live 5 and mint again.

It turned out many people stepped back because they didnt know the entry cost is like 1200$, that's a win for the community not to have ""ghost"" user who signed up and never buy a shoe.

Some people are just to lazy to tell their story and I couldnt care less for them. Maybe they prefer to compete over bots in the discord and telegram channel rather than having a genuine interaction between human.  Made some online friends along the way, and of course they can ask me questions directly regarding the apps.

The community should always be welcoming so it can grow in a positive direction and hopefully more and more people are doing this so stepn community can become a healthy one.

And some even invest in GST without playing Stepn (have read that on coinmarket, paople investing without having dyor).

2629;SweatyBarber229;"You won‚Äôt lose it if you send SOL through BEP20.. but you won‚Äôt be able to use it since the BEP20 in Stepn wallet is an actual BNB wallet. So to get the SOL back that was sent to BNB wallet, you‚Äôd have to import the BNB wallet with Metamask using the 12 seed phrase made on that wallet, add BEP20 network, and add Sol token to pop up that SOL on Metamask wallet. And to send that SOL in BEP20 back to your Binance accout, you need BNB for a fee‚Ä¶

2630;Nios_Cabron;Heard that Binance is highly invested in STEPN's GMT. Also it was mentioned, that Binance has a contract with STEPN Project's Team, that they are not allowed to take a single one of their Investment out of the Project until 2023. I think Binance has enough own drive to push this project, because they want to profit primarly from higher GMT prices, by increasing popularity of STEPN with dropping a Binance Chain and Sneaker-giveaways.;0;2022-05-01 20:20:11;t3_ug3v2e;/r/StepN/comments/ug3v2e/binancesolana_multi_chain/i6y24u1/

If you compare Sneakers on both Networks, you'll get one for about 1000 USD on Solana Chain and one for about 2500 USD on Binance Chain.

I also tried trading USDC in the StepN app in exchange for Solana because sending USDC to StepN wasnt an issue in the first place. But inapp trading was not possible either. Infrastructure is missing I guess...

Interesting that Binance has low/no SOL liquidity. I mean I bought 1 SOL for testing purposes and thought I own and obsess it now üòÖ

2734;Siccors;I learned about Stepn roughly 30 minutes ago, but isn't it kinda obvious? And dunno if you can call it a Ponzi, but it clearly is going to crash to zero. The only buy pressure in the entire system is from people buying Sneakers, repairing them or upgrading them. Literally the only reason you would do this, is because you expect to earn more money doing this. So in the end it works, as long as more people come in than people actually 'use' Stepn. Which sounds an awful lot like a Ponzi.;0;2022-05-01 11:40:09;t3_ufxkte;/r/StepN/comments/ufxkte/stepnponzi/i6w8f0x/

And that's how I found that both chains are not connected to one spending wallet on Stepn - there are two spending wallets - one for solana and one for BSC.

People need to understand the following:

1. Don't invest what you aren't prepared to lose.
2. Why are you investing in stepn? Invest in projects that you believe in and whose concept you support and what to help cultivate. If you believe in a project long term then who cares about a little bump in the road.

3. You haven't lost anything until you seek your Nft and stop playing (eg. Lock in your losses).

4. If you can't handle some swings in price or losing your investment then don't enter into crypto. Most projects fail. 

5. Don't go complaining that you are down and expect that to positively impact your situation. A new comer may read your misinformed opinion and be convinced to not get in.

2844;Particular_Pickle798;"Exactly. I suggest chilling in the discord ¬´¬†elite-chat¬†¬ª participate in the AMAs on discord, and ask questions around in the community every time you plan to invest in STEPN. Every week, founders are here to explain next moves, roadmaps, and answer questions. 

Anyone in the discord long enough would have anticipated GST sinking as we were all worried about GST skyrocketing. (It is not beneficial for the game).

2846;instrba;True, StepN seems to focused on the economic of the app. They do need to improve the app and it's usability so that they get more users who just want to actually use the app for running and improving health.

2853;Juber666;"Probably around 12-13 sol at the moment. I would say hold it and make use of it. Earn some money and wait for shit to get back up.

Worst time to sell is after a drop and worst time to buy is when prices are sky high. Do the opposite and sell when things pump up again but when it's down like rn just earn some gst and wait it out. 

StepN isn't like normal investments as you earn gst for free by just walking with a walker. Once the event ends show prices will instantly go up again but that's just my hunch.

If you don't care that much just sell it. 12 sol for quick sale and something higher up to 13 but will take longer";0;2022-04-30 22:57:30;t3_ufkbee;/r/StepN/comments/ufkbee/should_i_sell/i6ud4fc/
2854;Juber666;"I had a similar issue but it's probably worse rn


It's not StepN fault. Blame Solana.

The network is down right now and before that it's been congested AF so transactions have been taking forever as well as StepN is in beta so there's allot of optimisations that need to be made. I was on the fence for ages too and I bought a shoe for 15.28 sol which is kinds sad but long term I'll make the money back and then some and can always sell the show after I make some money to get my fill money's back.

Give it time, my funds took 8 hours and I was scared shirtless until I saw others were having same issue. Just wait it out and you can always send fund back to exchange or whatever wallet you use if you are scared now. Just remember the app has a long way to go but is no way near a scam when top dog investors are paying for it'd future to be successful.";0;2022-04-30 22:53:57;t3_ufkgx4;/r/StepN/comments/ufkgx4/what_the_actual_f_i_need_help_or_this_app_is_trash/i6ucp7z/
2855;polkamonx;"&gt;everyone saying ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt panic‚Äù is the first sign that I should panic.

The people who tell you this are the ones got in early, those are the ones who actually made money (still making most of the money on this). Same as all other ponzies like bitconnect or helium, regardless that probably tens of thousands will get completely wrekt on these projects the early investors always make a killing because the new nabs fomoing in paying their dividends. In the case of stepn this is acronym with the sky high price of the shoes and the increase in the token price.

I don't panic because I haven't bought a single sneaker after realizing what a megaponi this project is but the more days pass the more and more articles like this will pop up because you cannot hide the truth and this project will collapse like a house of cards. Right now all those who downvote these posts, instaban you from tg/discord are either project affilates or early investors who protecting their own bags.

They don't care about you or anyone else being rekt, they don't give a fly fk and saying anything bad about this project will make them start attacking you right away even if their argument is flawed or doesn't make any sense. 

Regarding the VCs they are like WCs in crypto. Just look at projects like Bluezilla who creating these launchpads like ethpad, adapad, bscpad, velaspad making people buy an insane amount (in some case of SOLRAZR like 50000$ worth of their junk token) to get a 100$ piss allocation in a new IDO and they say you will make your investment back in no time.... All of these projects with no exception are rugged and collapsed, all those who hold their tokens lost their money forever.

You should be extremely careful with any kind of crypto projects whether that is NFTs, crypto mining, or gaming like this with sky high floor price promising a quick and fast roi. It will work out for some people while thousands if not tens or hundreds of thousands will get completely rekt.

I myself decided NOT to buy any sneakers but made a good amount of money daytrading GMT/GST. Even any of these tokens I closely watch and wouldn't hold more than a couple of weeks. 

Yeah hope that sink in at the end I said weeks cos this will be going down like jimmy brown I guarantee you that, it doesn't make tho that you can't profit on it especially on a red day like this.";0;2022-04-30 22:36:06;t3_uf85sw;/r/StepN/comments/uf85sw/dont_panic_this_is_normal/i6uajxb/
