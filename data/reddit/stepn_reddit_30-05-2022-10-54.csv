3;redcrystal99;"&gt; If you have no faith in the project, why would you even spend time in this sub?

I have my reasonings and its quite entertaining pissing off the community 2 b honest.

&gt; In addition many high risk-reward-seekers went for the BNB/Sol-energy Split, even though they were warned, and many invested alot and lost alot when the news came that this too would be handeled. I take it you are one of those people?

Sure ive been accused of losing it all, to working for another M2E Coin, to shortening the project, and everything in between. It's pointless to figure out my motive. Just know im here.

Regardless of all that. I still dislike this project heavily. Hypothetically StepN could one day lock everyones account. Hold funds and vanish, but claim some sort of malfunction in the application. Due to their ability to geo-block accounts on a whim. Also the fact its a ponzi. The money is being generated out of thin air. It serves no purpose other than to fufill the pockets of teh developer and the early investors. I have yet to have anyone in this community tell me otherwise or tell me step by step why this holds any sort of value. Why are people being paid to exercise? Where is the money coming from?

4;Satans_finest_;"Ah, you are a child; I suspected but I didn‚Äôt want to be too presumptive or disrespectful, just in case. 
I didn‚Äôt get into the tokenomics, bc they are obviously flawed. I literally JUST said, the success of this project is based on hype lol. It relies on new users to maintain supply and demand and to fund the ultimately unsustainable returns of current users, like most defi projects, etc. That said, the hype is absolutely not dead yet and therefore, neither is the project and that‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt seem to understand. (That‚Äôs ok, you‚Äôll learn! :) The project is in beta and many of the features haven‚Äôt been rolled out yet. This includes leasing which will expand their addressable market and continue to fund the returns and maintain demand for a min. The people who are already in will get out with profit if they play the game strategically. I personally wouldn‚Äôt get in at this point, unless the stepn team became much more competent overnight and rectified the issues that will ultimately kill the project. I‚Äôm not sure how old you are, but it‚Äôs good that you recognized that, not everyone does.
That said, your arrogance is not only off putting, which you may not care about, but it will actually only end up harming you and your own investments, no one else. You may consider a bit of humility and respect, and approaching things with a sincere curiosity rather than the juvenile desire to be right, at the expense of others. (All you ‚Äúpin this‚Äù comments.) You may even consider that you can learn from those you‚Äôre insulting, who‚Äôve been through a markets ups and downs and understand the multitude of factors at play in any given market. 
Nonetheless, despite your obnoxious comments, it‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre exposing yourself to various asset classes and learning. The patience and perspective will come with time, though later rather than sooner if you maintain your current approach.

However, should anyone have something constructive to say I find most people in this sub and on discord do their due diligence and engage positively in a conversation.

For a lot of us, the timing of these FUD attacks is suspicious. The devs are trying to oblige with legal requirements (china), change the mechanism to stop mint farming and a bear market. Its a perfect shit storm.

43;reverent-girl;"I don‚Äôt think this argument has validity. There is literally zero intrinsic value in the app. Let me explain. 

Currently, every single person that invests in the app does it because they think they will make money. There are a dozen free fitness apps that do the fitness tracking part 10 times better than StepN. Well, some may say that StepN was able to get them into fitness while other apps couldn‚Äôt. That is a fair point. The idea of losing out on money is a very strong incentive. Then again, you could just make an app where you have to put X amount of money in an account somewhere and can only get the money back by walking. Few people would agree to this. Like I said it has no intrinsic value and so your argument is bad. 

This is my argument for why StepN will recover: 

1) By the nature of the app you need to use it every day. This creates a very strong community of people that have StepN on their minds daily. 

2) The market still has a long way to grow! I can see potentially 10x the user base a year from now. 

3) There are actual tangible market forces that can explain why the market is down. The ban on Chinese users and subsequent flood of the market is a main factor. While only 5% of total users are directly impacted, this could temporarily double or triple the shoes on the market. 

4) All of crypto is down right now. Alt coins are particularly impacted. It‚Äôs sad seeing GST down 75-80% but other comparable coins are all down 25-60%. 

5) It‚Äôs fun! I like the app. I like the premise. I think most people believe the same! As with all crypto/NFT projects the user perception is very important and I believe the Dev team have done an overall good job. 

Remember, this is a high risk investment! Don‚Äôt invest what you can‚Äôt afford to lose. Diversification is the best friend of long term wealth.";2022-05-29 23:36:49;t3_v0jn8r;/r/StepN/comments/v0jn8r/is_stepn_going_die_like_axie_infinity_or_will_it/iahfhdy/;[{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5785390734672546}];Negative;0,5785390734672546

80;HoneydewNo359;Ok let‚Äôs use words someone at your age can understand. I bought 1 shoe at 16 sol right. $1400 for that one but that one was level 14 with 7.6 efficiency and 9.3 resilience. That is my main shoe that I got really lucky in buying. Spent 30 minutes on the market getting it by refreshing the latest shoes to be put up. Then in the future I realized I wanted 3 so I bought 2 more at 13 sol. At that time it was $1200 each. So i invested a total of $3,800. my girlfriend wanted to get in on the project as well when I started so at 13 sol per shoe at $1200 each that means $3,600. So total of us combined spent $7,400. We made back $4500 from our runs so far. That includes all my spendings for leveling up and everything. Again I have a spreadsheet for this. So that means I need to make $1900 to break even. However I did not hold. I am a part of a Facebook group run by a YouTuber covering stepn and there people buy up shoes very fast. So when I saw the price reach $8 I listed my shoes up before I even posted the don‚Äôt panic post. Yes maybe I did not have the shoes but I was trying to give a positive outlook to people getting into the game as it‚Äôs true only added 20 days to ROI. So buying back shoes during the crashes and then reselling and buying back   I saved $500 per shoe over the course of this month. 6 X $500= $3000. Minus the $1900 I needed to break even which leaves me with $1100 profit plus the last 2 weeks of running.

You bought in at the peak height around $7 and you literally said you will make ROI in 20 days if it stays at this price. Meaning you bought in at $6-8. GST is floating around $1.28ish. SOL has dropped half its value also. You are down fcking bad kid. Lol, idiot talking about making ROI. THis the 3rd retard i caught lying about this on here.

If you know where to look on YouTube - recaps of investors (macro investors specifically like Raoul), it can be a great way to learn about the markets. It's also really important to get a broad sense of how everything is doing combined with on-chain and SOME technical analysis from multiple sources - InvestAnswers host James is absolutely amazing with crypto and he doesn't shill anything. It's the shilling YouTubers you have to be cautious of imo. Look for content by the experienced investors. I agree Elon isn't the best example but his opinion is spot on about survival of good projects, and is shared by many other respected investors. 

The only issue I have with reading historical pieces of similar projects is that past performance doesn't dictate future performance, and in this case the StepN team is very aware of what happened with Axie Infinity and take many steps to avoid similar outcomes. 

I'm general, I take what Devs say with a grain of salt but in this case, I'd say you're smart to listen to them since they're very transparent.

for me, STEPN is the best thing ever. I‚Äôve run for like 15 years of my life for free, never expected anything else.

Now there‚Äôs something that pays me to do the same thing I‚Äôve always done. It doesn‚Äôt matter if GST is like 10 cents at some point, cause 1 dollar per run is better than what I‚Äôve always earned, meaning 0 dollars.

i think some people either are not runners or not sportspeople in general. If I have something that gives me money, even if its 1 dollar or whatever, I‚Äòm always gonna do it, because its literally free cash flow.

on the other hand why would you play Axie Infinity if it doesnt give you money? Its not something you would normally do. Running is something I‚Äôll always do cause I cant live without that dopamine rush. that‚Äôs STEPN biggest strength. So as long as you have a few bucks to start, its a no brainer since you just have to push a button when doing your favourite activity.

There is still more pain to come in the markets BUT it will rebound eventually, just hodl and dollar cost average into gmt, the deflationary one.

Also, listen to some people like Raoul Pal, Elon Musk, and savied investors who have survived multiple market corrections and recessions talk on YouTube about the situation of the markets. Educate yourself and know that this market situation is bad but it's not permanent. It's also not just StepN, everything falls together. Broaden your view of the markets.

You bought in at around 14-15 SOL Floor price. SOL was trading around $52 at that time.

52 x 14.5 = $754 invested

GST was around $2.90-$3.05

You netted around = $300ish give or take in 2 weeks if you sold everything to USDC everyday(which i HIGHLY doubt since you're still hodling).

The SOL floor now is 8.2 SOL and SOL is trading at $42.

42 x 8 = If you sold your sneaker its value would be $336.

Now to take into account the fees of selling the sneaker of 6%

Would be around $316.

Meaning you are down -$438 USD currently just based on the Sneakers value.

Rug pulls are full of marketing campaigns, influencers, and promotions with huge follower growth that doesn‚Äôt make sense. Encouraging people to get in as fast as possible to create a spike of interest and incomes before pulling the plug out.

Constant AMA‚Äôs with both founders taking the time to explain carefully weekly milestones and updates. Real life events across the globe.

188;Mundane_Marzipan_679;"STEPN. Solition of dumping market

The price of GST and GMT tokens has fallen due to the fact that the floor price has fallen. 

The floor price has fallen due to the fact that:
1. Of course, ‚ÄúChina‚Äù, but this is not the main reason.
2. FUD and panic sales.  Yes, but there was a problem from the beginning.
3. The main reason is that the mint is cheap, there are a lot of minted sneakers.  Demand is less than supply.  

Solution: 
1. Significantly increase the price per mint to burn more tokens, the price of tokens will rise.

199;superplexbeats;"Time will tell. StepN is in a period of aggressive growth and if realms are launched in quick succession, this creates more arbitrage opportunities to FOMO into. This will likely create more bagholders (those that invest at ATH prices). This may be the only strategy though to be honest - in order to beat the copycat competitors and grow the user base, the pain needs to be temporary and quick.

If the gameplay is identical between chains, then the GST token prices should align eventually. However, that's unlikely, since we already know that a new realm could be an entirely different genre of game and the equivalent GST token can be renamed.

Not sure what the future plan will be for energy sharing, but a concern I have is that there's a risk the original game no longer becomes relevant as people could constantly jump from chain to chain, seeking the best earnings. StepN would lose its brand identity.

The positives at the moment are that the team seems to be working flat out on development and communication is starting to become more timely and professional.

245;Familiar_Visit7488;"there were countless users from mainland china who were doing heavy mint-farming on BSC chain. since SOL chain has been there for a long time and floor prices on SOL are more or less stable, a new chain on BSC with low supply was best opportunity to make huge profit for those mint-farmers. they were minting in heavy numbers making huge profit. StepN team decided to roll out minting scrolls because of this, which will come up in the next update I guess. Also yesterday, StepN posted an update that they will ban the app for China because of their own government regulations. StepN was already not available in China (mainland) to download. but mint farmers were purchasing phones from Hong-Kong or other regions and then downloading the app from the Hong Kong App Store. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not saying that BSC minting was ""only"" done by Mainland China users, but yes it was ""mostly"" done by those users. Even though I think they are just banning the GPS, which will affect the runners, but not sure if it also affects the minters.

&amp;#x200B;

The floor prices dropped significantly ever since StepN announced the ban for Mainland users. If I am not wrong, the users from that region who were heavily invested in mint-farming are offloading their sneakers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean we have US ambassadors such as ‚ÄúBitcoin Daily‚Äù who have already hosted a live meetup in Miami and the team is very aware of the usage in the US. 

However, after the China ban, I would say moral of the story is that anything is possible. I would say it‚Äôs basically a guarantee that this will be regulated in the US eventually if it gets big enough to get attention of regulators. At that point, since it‚Äôs technically in the TOS, Stepn would reserve the right to shut our accounts down since we violated TOS. 

Fortunately it does not appear as if that is their MO since they are giving China plenty of time to clear their assets off the platform before shutting down.

264;Familiar_Visit7488;"GST-BSC was already overpriced. When SOL users were complaining that StepN is abandoning Solana users and making BSC users grow exponentially, the mods and StepN team tried to reassure all SOL users that the prices on BSC will cool down. They already told Solana users to not panic (now those users are quiet).

&amp;#x200B;

As for the anyone who invested in BSC, prices are more of what I would like to call ""stable"" at this point. $10 for GST-BSC is like $2 for GST-SOL. As long as it stabilizes around that point, I think it is a fair price. ROI is still 35-40 days at these prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course if anyone who tried to FOMO at the top of BSC must be feeling negative right now. But if you are in crypto, you should know that you do not want to chase pumps. It is more reasonable to invest when the prices at a stable point, as compared to when prices are rising exponentially and people put all their money at top because of FOMO. It happened to Solana users as well a few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you are talking about floor price, then this is exactly what the team was trying to point out. Gilgamesh pointed it out many times that BSC is an experimental chain right now. It had limited supply of sneakers and limited users. She advised SOL users not to be get misled and that the prices in BSC will cool down soon. And now it happened and people are still complaining.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Prices high --&gt; People unhappy

Prices low --&gt; People unhappy

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My focus is to secure the ROI and then enjoy the game. StepN is not the ticket to become rich but more a ticket to adopt a healthier lifestyle with an added incentive. 35-40 days ROI is still very lucrative from any investment point of view (even if it does not provide additional health benefits).

&amp;#x200B;

I think most of the people who get unhappy are those who get misled by Youtubers and social-media ""influencers"" about ""a magical app that can 10x your money in a few days"". They calculate lucrative ROIs at the pico-top when the project is at full-hype and lure new investors in who have never done their own research.

&amp;#x200B;

But honestly I am waiting for the AMA today to see what changes they are going to make. It will surely bring more light on the entire situation and their future roadmap.

About Axie, I honestly have no idea. I never played the game, but as far as I know and correct me if I am wrong, Axie does not allow AXS token to be earned by playing the game. They have another token which you earn while playing the game. AXS is a governance token, but users do not have the option to earn it. Yes you can stake it and get the rewards, but minting it and earning by playing the game is not an option. It was not there and I am pretty sure even right now it is not the case.

Again I am not a StepN maxi, and obviously there are chances that the project will eventually lose value. In terms of probability, every crypto project has a chance to fail, nothing is 100% certain. 

But the app is still in Beta and it is still improving and bringing a lot of mew features and experimenting with different game mechanics to make the  game more sustainable.

Will they succeed? I hope they do, and as far as I can tell, until now, they seem to be on the right track. If they lose their track in the future and it becomes unsustainable, of course it will lose value.

But as you said, enjoy while it lasts. After securing the ROI, I think it is better to focus more on the health benefit side rather than focusing on ‚Äúbecoming rich with 20 minutes jogging‚Äù side. 

But I still think the game will last for some time at least.";2022-05-28 08:43:51;t3_uz3vpa;/r/StepN/comments/uz3vpa/addressing_all_fuds_going_around_for_the_past_few/iaakie0/;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6914257407188416}];Neutral;0,6914257407188416

270;Familiar_Visit7488;"Your have a valid point. But as your own words suggested ‚Äúuntil the last GMT is unlocked‚Äù.

GMT has a fixed supply, unlike GST which is unlimited and its balance depends between minting vs burning. People were worried that this ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù supply would result into a death spiral.

You understand the basics of crypto well, but that is not the case with normal users. If I talk about circulating supply, unlocks, vesting schedule etc, it would take a whole new article. 

Any crypto project with a fixed token supply is released based on a fixed vesting schedule. GMT unlocks will begin from next year, and right now the game is still in Beta which means a lot of new features will be introduced and a lot of issues will be addressed. Team has already said they are aware of the reasons why Axie failed and that is why they are trying to introduce their own gameplay.

There is literally no crypto project out there which is deflationary ‚Äúright now‚Äù at the date. But the projects with fixed supply, like GMT, will become deflationary after the whole supply is released. As you said yourself, even Bitcoin is not deflationary ‚Äúright now‚Äù but it will be after the max supply has been minted. I may not have a correct term to address this case, but my point was unlike GST which has an unlimited supply, which was the point of concern for many new users, GMT has a fixed supply and the gameplay is to reach level-30, unlock GMT earnings, and then users will have the option to switch between the earnings. If GST price to fall below GMT, users can switch to GMT and take away the selling pressure from GST and vice versa. Also more people opt to earn GMT at a certain time, the lesser GMT they will receive (just like in Bitcoin the miners reward get halved during every halving cycle).

The mechanism is complex, if someone wants to understand it, they can dive into the whitepaper and listen to the AMAs. But for new users who are not even familiar with blockchains and cryptocurrency, I wanted to make sure they get the distinction between the nature of GST and GMT.

And yes a part of GMT tokens were sold during private sale, but which crypto project has not done that? This is literally how the team raises initial funds to start a project. One cannot expect a team to build a project from their own garage with $0 funding. Of course a project needs initial funding. The point is whether the team is able to build a working viable product with that funding or just turn into a disappointment. Here the team is actually building a product that is helping people grow healthier. StepN is one of the few projects that actually had a working product during its launch. They did not launch a theoretical cryptocurrency with promises of a golden game and then just waiting to dump the private sales token on the users. But instead team actually came up with a product during the launch (remember we are still in Beta with a product that works really well) and they are still making a lot of improvements. 

Also the private sales token of GMT has a vesting schedule and the unlocks will begin from next year. Those tokens will not get unlocked on a single day where the team rug-pulls and runs away with all the money. The unlocks are periodic and at a fixed time frame.

The theoretical positive scenario is this; new users, more viable game mechanics to be introduced this year, more real world partnerships with other sports brand and other factors would be able to generate enough net positive revenue that it will compensate for the token unlocks and the withdraw sell pressure from users. Or else, if the users lose interest and the unlocks become overwhelming after a certain period of time when the selling pressure increase too much, of course like any other crypto project, StepN will also lose its value.

I am not a StepN maxi, and even if it goes to $0, i would still use the app after securing my ROI. Even if the financial benefit goes to 0, it is still giving me health benefits which is something not a lot of play to earn games can claim. But my point was that there is still a lot of time for that to happen, also it is one of ‚Äú100% negative scenarios unfolding one after the other‚Äù case.

I have been in crypto and blockchain space for long enough time to say that I have 0 concerns with any private sales of tokens. Every project runs a private sale to secure initial fundings. As long as the team has a working product, it should be of no concern. All big projects like Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana had a portion of their tokens sold in private sales and went through unlocks. But like I said it happens at a fixed schedule. 

If you believe the token price is not sustainable and the project is losing its value, of course you can opt out and you will have enough time. Or you can be like one of those users who are only concerned about their ROI, and after that they use the app more for health benefits and less for financial incentives.";2022-05-28 08:29:10;t3_uz3vpa;/r/StepN/comments/uz3vpa/addressing_all_fuds_going_around_for_the_past_few/iaajjxc/;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.659774124622345}];Neutral;0,659774124622345

276;TheRealPaulTurner;"Thank you for the effort on this.  In addition to AMAs, this level of written explanation addressing new functionality, changes to mechanics and addressing concerns, no matter how obvious one might think the facts are, would go a long way to keeping the community positive.

The term FUD gets thrown around way too much in crypto and while there are genuine detractors to the project, I feel that a lot of people are new to crypto and further, don't understand tokenomics and market dynamics.   There is a fair bit of complexity in the STEPN system and even though I consider myself pretty seasoned in this space, I find the future hard to assess especially with a lot of cloak and dagger talk.  I deal with the uncertainty by just taking a portion of every day's earning out into stables.  I do this as a percentage every day without fail.  Having ridden projects to zero I think it is important that people understand that DCAing both in and out is important.   Nothing is guaranteed, always derisk as you go.

The STEPN AMAs and Barndog make an effort to explain things to this level of detail but often I find the founders are speaking from a position where they understand their vision and economics and assume that their audience should.  During the emergency AMA today they showed particular frustration with people not understanding.  As the saying goes, if the student doesn't understand, it is the teacher's failure, not the student's.

supply, it is deflationary and it will have the highest value in the

Having a limited supply doesn't mean much if you can't make it to the end. for ex : Jan 2027 will have 80% of tokens in circulation - as seen on the litepaper. Inflation is going to be huge, 8x increase in supply in less than 5 years.   
For this not to be an issue, new investors have to come in and burn, hold the token. Sounds familiar?  And ofc, no one will burn anything if there's no current/future financial gain.  


AXS had a limited supply as well and look what happened... They didn't even distribute anything from the play to earn AXS pile ( less selling pressure ) and ""burning"" was on point  
( \~70% AXS from minting went to treasury )  


I'm afraid this will share a similar fate so enjoy it while it lasts. And after it ends try and think of the positives : Stepn helped you build a healthy habit. Axie helped hundred of thousands of Filipinos during the pandemic.

For the context: I live in China,  have good friends living in Shanghai and every here and there around the Mainland. As well as I have been a part of a private crypto investment company in Guangzhou. 

Half of China isn't on lockdown. No idea where this comes from, but it's not true. Shanghai has been hit pretty hard and people there have been on a strict lockdown for the past two months at the very least. Outside Shanghai only a handful of low tier villages have been locked down and that didn't last for long. 

Taking a look at tier one cities and metropolitans like Beijing, Guangzhou and even Shenzhen (which had its own share of a lockdown not so long ago) - everything is fine. You get a neighborhood on a week-long lockdown and that's it. 

In regards to crypto being banned in China in general. Being banned doesn't mean it's not being used, traded, mined and whatnot. The CCP has been on the move to roll out bans after bans in the past years, yet at the same time they push eYuan. I am not saying it's the same thing, I am not, but what I am trying to say is that all those people that have been involved in crypto haven't gone anywhere.

Right now with Chinese ID cards and/or foreign passports if one is lucky to have being declined from being used for KYC - acquiring crypto in general is harder than ever, but is doable. Ever heard about P2P? That's a huge market over here with, for instance, localcryptos merchants and speculates trading ETH/BTC as low as 4% above the market (last time I may or may have not bought some).

While a bunch of markets and exchanges are inaccessible without VPN, Huobi is still yet accessible at this point and it is usable. Tricky, but usable, and it is one of the main tools for trading and/or investing in crypto for the local audience.

Chinese stock market is worse than crypto in terms of constant volatility. If anything there are a few trends to follow, but that is it. I personally met people who aren't internationally- or global-minded, true wumaos, who would approach me to ask about crypto. And those folks don't earn as much as foreigners in general (outside Mainland, if we compare countries' GDP and/or simply the lowest guaranteed wages).

So... Why? I am happy if I helped you broaden your mind a bit. But the point stays the same:

Shanghai has been hit pretty hard and people there have been on a strict lockdown for the past two months at the very least. Outside Shanghai only a handful of low tier villages have been locked down and that didn't last for long. 

Taking a look at tier one cities and metropolitans like Beijing, Guangzhou and even Shenzhen (which had its own share of a lockdown not so long ago) - everything is fine. You get a neighborhood on a week-long lockdown and that's it. 

In regards to crypto being banned in China in general. Being banned doesn't mean it's not being used, traded, mined and whatnot. The CCP has been on the move to roll out bans after bans in the past years, yet at the same time they push eYuan. I am not saying it's the same thing, I am not, but what I am trying to say is that all those people that have been involved in crypto haven't gone anywhere.

Right now with Chinese ID cards and/or foreign passports if one is lucky to have being declined from being used for KYC - acquiring crypto in general is harder than ever, but is doable. Ever heard about P2P? That's a huge market over here with, for instance, localcryptos merchants and speculates trading ETH/BTC as low as 4% above the market (last time I may or may have not bought some).

While a bunch of markets and exchanges are inaccessible without VPN, Huobi is still yet accessible at this point and it is usable. Tricky, but usable, and it is one of the main tools for trading and/or investing in crypto for the local audience.

Chinese stock market is worse than crypto in terms of constant volatility. If anything there are a few trends to follow, but that is it. I personally met people who aren't internationally- or global-minded, true wumaos, who would approach me to ask about crypto. And those folks don't earn as much as foreigners in general (outside Mainland, if we compare countries' GDP and/or simply the lowest guaranteed wages).

So... Why? I am happy if I helped you broaden your mind a bit. But the point stays the same: 

* if you didn't know about this even in the slightest - that means you are ignorant. We're ignorant to write that bollocks comment. But it's quite alright, no worries;
* or if you still believe in all of what you've posted in that comment and you are still surprised with those 5% (oh and mind you, a lot of expats use StepN, those that are involved in crypto space), then that makes you delusional.

304;Kaladin_the13th;"I don't see your point. The possibilities to burn and re-invest are totally optional, you can also choose to just buy a pair, walk and cash-in, it's your choice. Everyone has to decide on their own investing strategy, like with everything else, be it stepn, stocks or real estate.

Using hypotheticals leads nowhere. Your example wld mean Stepn just stops working, shutting down app. It's like saying ""what if Microsoft wld stop paying their staff? They wld leave and Microsoft stock wld crash"". I mean, like yeah xD
Nobody denies that we need demand for GST to have value. That's basic economics. Doesn't mean it's a Ponzi.

Just to have a common base of argument, here's the definition:
A¬†Ponzi scheme¬†(/Ààp…ínzi/,¬†Italian:¬†[Ààpontsi]) is a form of¬†fraud¬†that lures¬†investors¬†and pays¬†profits¬†to earlier investors with¬†funds¬†from more recent investors. (Wikipedia) 

Does this happen in Stepn? Technically no, but kind-of yes Sometimes, if the new investors decide to buy GST (but even then nobody *lured* them to do so). I myself i.e. have bought a pair of shoes with Sol, never have bought a single GST. Now we don't know what the seller did with the Sol. Maybe he traded for GST to mint the next pair, maybe not. We know someone is buying GST directly, bc there is demand, and that's most likely people wanting a headstart and quicker leveling or outside investors trying to hop on the Stepn wagon. But both of those are not necessary to play the game, not even advertised for by devs and whitepaper. So I don't see how that part of the definition applies fully here.
And most important, how can this be a fraud if everything is transparent in the whitepaper and all those AMAs? Ponzi is a form of fraud, so without fraud, no ponzi. Simple. If the devs do sth shady and rugpull or sth, then yes, it was fraud. But they yet have to show such behavior.";2022-05-27 22:54:59;t3_uyukyi;/r/StepN/comments/uyukyi/the_ponzi_is_quickly_collapsing_i_tried_to_warn/ia90mmb/;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5597587823867798}];Neutral;0,5597587823867798

Ultimately when it reaches it's total minted supply, which by the way is being halved every 3 years, so that is long time away, The burning mechanism would have already reduced the total circulating supply by a lot, so all of this has major upside price pressure for gmt which would balance out the sell pressure.

335;reverent-girl;"Kekw you are being a bit delusional. There is currently not a single bit of actual monetary value backing up StepN. Walking is a cost, but it does not bring monetary value into the project. If like you said Nike does a promotional with StepN then it could have some real value. That value would be some proportion of the discount provided. The ‚ÄúGame‚Äù and ‚Äúfitness‚Äù features of the app also bring no monetary value into the project. In both instances there are much better free games and fitness apps. 

The current price of shoes is essentially based on expected earnings. Expected earnings is dependent on current owners reinvesting and new customers buying in. In the white pages it is made quite clear that GST is inherently inflationary and the supply is only restricted by people burning them through upgrades and in app purchases. 

This should make it very clear that StepN will 100% collapse into oblivion at some point. Could be next week or it could be in 10 years. It all depends on public perception of the project, the external success of sol and crypto in general, and management decisions of the devs.

I am not sure what the proportions are of new buyers and just people upgrading. I‚Äôm sure upgrades is more. In one of their articles STEPN acknowledged P2E has a Ponzi like nature, but to avoid this they implemented several key elements. One of them being to try and keep people playing, and not let them reach ‚Äúthe end game‚Äù easy. Because at the end game, people will cash out, which creates supply. 

Burning tokens by upgrading is a way of keeping demand up, and supply down. Which is probably why $GST performed really well earlier. But I‚Äôm afraid the lower it will go, the less interest people will have in STEPN. 

Idk, time will tell I guess. Main reason I posted this is because I saw with Terra how many people straight up started posting about suicide, it‚Äôs just sad to see people lose their everything.

My vague understanding of a ponzi scheme is that existing users only make money by getting more to join and same with new investors, they only make money when they invite more new investors. 

With stepn I can see how one might see it as a ponzi due to the initial cost to get started. However once you buy a shoe, you can start earning without inviting more people. Also as far as I know, there is no referral program incentivizing people to invite new players and get commission based on shoe sales. Please correct me if im wrong on that.

Also with the (eventual) release of a rental system the initial cost will likely be next to nothing to get started. You could say the app is unsustainable without constant flow of new customers, but that can be said about any industry. The arms industry isnt a ponzi scheme yet it requires people to kill and run out of ammo so they must buy more. Idk if thats a good comparison but its what popped into my head and made sense as im writing this.

I dont want to tell ,- go buy its good opportunity, no i will not because everyone doing their own research.

Of course not gonna compare but when after 2018 bitcoin rally it dropped so much ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù not believed in it but after 3 years we saw unrealistic highs.. my friend from work resigned last year because he got enough of crypto to not work anymore, and he was still buying ( 2017-2021) when everything crashed.. not financial advice here.

who hold 200gst for more 30 days get 1 comman shoe box that cannot be trade

2.at this point of game with this price of shoe and gst we need more burning so I think it's better to available minting at 10 level so more gst burned for leveling up and it help to revive gst
we can something like this in energy sharing between chains too.I mean for example if level of the shoe less than 10 in sol network it didn't effect on bsc chain energy so bsc users should burn sol gst too

You don't migrate your account, you change to the to bnb smart chain. When I said migrate, I meant these users switched chain, bought a bnb sneaker and exercising using that shoe.

To your last point - no one knows for sure what will happen to stepn. Like you, I am enjoying this app alot so I'm going to continue walking daily and hope that prices will recover in the future. If prices never recovers, I'm okay with that - I'm getting paid to exercise and I think that's a fantastic deal.";2022-05-27 07:38:00;t3_uxkqwx;/r/StepN/comments/uxkqwx/a_summary_of_binancesol_energy_sharing_why_it_was/ia62bxd/;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6008535027503967}];Neutral;0,6008535027503967

Two things I would say. 1) minting seems to be more incentivized  on the binance chain since shoes sell for a lot more there and 2) about gmt mining... those people that bought the 8 sol shoes and 1 binance shoe so they could share the 9 energy on the binance side will not be going out to but new sol shoes. They will probably use one of the pairs of shoes they previously purchased.  

Right now the Sol sneaker price is dropping meaning either the supply of sol sneakers is too high or demand is not there right now.  Or maybe a bit of both.

I have crazy excel tables pulling web data from different sources for GST, GMT and SOL and refreshing ever 30 minutes to calculate what was/is happening and what I have to to do with leveling, spending, re-investing etc. So I already got my ROI back and I was luck enough to mint 2 uncommon sneakers using two common sneakers.

I am not complaining about my ROI but this drop made me feel the way I felt when I was burned with a scam. My lost was very small at that time and it was around 500-600 USD but it made me so mad that I could drown those so-called ""team members"" in a one bucket of water. This situation with GST/SOL made me re-visit my previous frustration and I felt for people loosing money because of scammers.
