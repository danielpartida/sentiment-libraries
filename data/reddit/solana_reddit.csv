3;SolanaNoob;My blind guess would be that many more Solana projects are VC funded and people that paid for them have CeFi backgrounds and are proprietary minded, but with Ethereum and the inherent need for products to be less complex due to gas costs a lot more projects can be made by smaller teams doing it for shit and giggles rather than a stack of embedded engineers.;0;2022-05-23 15:41:04;t3_uttqse;/r/solana/comments/uttqse/can_someone_tell_me_why_so_many_solana_defi/i9p0kf2/

26;Boss_BrownSugar;"Probably because of the fees commission on the staking service. They can afford the extra apy to incentivize users, autocompounding is not used as well because of the fees that come with you trying to withdraw before end of lockup time.

Though they are higher low risk apy in DeFi too
Have you researched about Marinade.finance? There is no lockup and you get a base 5.98% apy in your tokenized proof of stake mSol which you can swap at any time!
Lots of strategies for more yield, personally I go from marinade to provide mSol LP in orca. Win win.

You can check out more integrated defi here

It's all non-custodial and you can withdraw at any time without any delays or lockups (it's liquid staking), there's very little risk for you since the protocol was [created by Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/stake-pool), [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three companies, and made [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code).

I'm totally aware that me saying that doesn't make it true, and there's a ton I'm probably missing, but it's the impression I and everyone else I know who is in the nft space gets whenever we dip our toes into the solana pool.

44;FunEarnings;"Exchanges try to get you to stake with them on the premise of a high APY, but that comes at the cost of losing self-custody of your SOL (meaning that you no longer have full control over your SOL). You're basically getting paid extra to give your SOL to an exchange, and then the exchange can do whatever they want with that SOL (for instance, they can lend it out to others for a higher rate) until you request a withdrawal. I wouldn't recommend staking with an exchange since they can decide at any time to block your withdrawal.

The best place to stake your SOL with a consistent APY is with a stake pool like BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)), it's super beginner friendly and you can stake in just a few clicks. Since it's a stake pool, BlazeStake automatically spreads your stake across several validators, so you don't need to spend time choosing individual validators or doing extensive research on that, as BlazeStake will take care of all of that for you.

When you stake with BlazeStake, your stake is represented in liquid bSOL tokens, so you don't need to worry about the 2-3 days of staking and unstaking delays. Plus, when you stake with BlazeStake, there are some extra rewards that you'll get besides the baseline 5-6% standard APY, you'll be supporting the broader Solana ecosystem through the BlazeStake Treasury, and you'll also be helping with decentralization since your SOL will be staked with multiple validators.

The stake pool program was [built by Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/) and [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three separate companies, plus the code is all [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code), so you can be sure your funds are safe when using the stake pool!";0;2022-05-22 21:03:33;t3_uvjsy8;/r/solana/comments/uvjsy8/difference_between_cexstaking_and_regular_staking/i9lwaiq/

124;FunEarnings;"First of all, Binance is NOT ""trustable"" and has been quite problematic for many people when trying to withdraw their SOL from the platform. Binance tries to get you to stake with them on the premise of a high APY, but that comes at the cost of losing self-custody to your SOL (meaning that Binance can choose to block your withdrawal).

The best place to stake your SOL with a consistent APY is with a stake pool like BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)), it's super beginner friendly and you can stake in just a few clicks. Since it's a stake pool, BlazeStake automatically spreads your stake across several validators, so you don't need to spend time choosing individual validators or doing extensive research on that, as BlazeStake will take care of all of that for you.

When you stake with BlazeStake, your stake is represented in liquid bSOL tokens, so you don't need to worry about the 2-3 days of staking and unstaking delays. Plus, when you stake with BlazeStake, there are some extra rewards that you'll get besides the baseline 5-6% standard APY, you'll be supporting the broader Solana ecosystem through the BlazeStake Treasury, and you'll also be helping with decentralization since your SOL will be staked with multiple validators.

The stake pool program was [built by Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/) and [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three separate companies, plus the code is all [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code), so you can be sure your funds are safe when using the stake pool!";0;2022-05-21 18:07:03;t3_uujo6l;/r/solana/comments/uujo6l/staking_sol_in_binance/i9h44ko/

135;Rough_Data_6015;"I assume you want to send SPL tokens and not programs to Ethereum.  Every chain has it's own version of a certain token, for example USDC on Solana is not the same as USDC on Ethereum or AVAX or any other chain. If you send USDC to another blockchain you will end up with a bridged version of USDC which you will need to swap to the ""real"" USDC version on that blockchain.

Some bridges will automatically swap popular tokens like USDC for you so you don't have to do this intermediate step yourself. Portal doesn't swap for you, you will need to do this yourself.

So yea you can use portal but you first have to find a pool on Ethereum to swap your portal version tokens or they will be useless (you can always send them back if you can't find a way to swap).

This may sound complicated so I'll give some examples:

Buy ETH on Solana and send it to Ethereum with portal you will end up with ETH in your wallet(no swapping required).

Buy USDC on Solana and send it to Ethereum with portal you will end up with USDCso and you will need to go to Uniswap to swap USDCso to USDC.";0;2022-05-21 15:43:57;t3_uuooka;/r/solana/comments/uuooka/newbie_q_how_do_i_send_spl_programs_to_ethereum/i9glce8/

Kudelski Security audited Solana itself.

Your stake is delegated to more than 450+ validators who distribute each epoch so there is no actual liquidity to exploit in marinade itself, just in other dexes. It's just a massive way to also distribute stake to help the minority validators as well. The sol is with the validators passively. The mSol is your proof of stake.

Risks always exist in defi, but mSol's tokenomics and Marinade protocol are designed with security as a major concern.

165;FunEarnings;I would highly recommend staking your SOL in a stake pool like BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)) to get a stable 5-6% APY with very little risk. Since staking is a protocol-level feature, and since the stake pool program was designed and built by Solana Labs, if you can trust Solana as a blockchain to store money then you can probably trust a stake pool as well. Plus, when you stake with a stake pool like BlazeStake, your stake is spread across several validators to support decentralization and secure the network while allowing you to earn extra rewards through optional airdrops and support the broader ecosystem through the BlazeStake Treasury.;0;2022-05-21 02:30:19;t3_uuc6vr;/r/solana/comments/uuc6vr/best_projects_on_solana/i9emody/
166;FunEarnings;"Best place to buy is probably KuCoin ([https://solfaucet.togatech.org/kucoin](https://solfaucet.togatech.org/kucoin)), they've always been fairly reliable for me and also don't require extensive KYC up to a certain limit so it's easier to get set up.

After you get that SOL into Phantom, please consider staking with BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)), it's super intuitive and you can stake in just a few clicks. It's a stake pool, which means that BlazeStake automatically spreads your stake across several validators, so you don't need to spend time choosing individual validators or doing extensive research on that, as BlazeStake will take care of all of that for you. When you stake with BlazeStake, your stake is represented in bSOL tokens, so you don't need to worry about the 2-3 days of unstaking delays. Plus, when you stake with BlazeStake, there are some extra rewards that you'll get besides the baseline 5-6% standard APY, you'll be supporting the broader Solana ecosystem through the BlazeStake Treasury, and you'll also be helping with decentralization since your SOL will be staked with multiple validators. The stake pool program was [built by Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/) and [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three separate companies, plus the code is all [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code), so you can be sure your funds are safe when using the stake pool!";0;2022-05-21 02:26:17;t3_uua7z8;/r/solana/comments/uua7z8/getting_sol/i9em8iq/

I haven't looked into Solana pay all that much. I thought that it kept transaction data history on chain to an extent? It's mostly just translating a real world transaction into a solana USDC SPL token transaction though.

Mango markets has tons of unique code and just breaking down small parts of their market is very difficult. So I think maybe you haven't looked into the code much.

You just happened to look at the wrong projects maybe. There's tons of very complex/long solana smart contract code out there. Orca will for sure have a bit for their own liquidity system.

200;SolanaNoob;"I regularly milk Anchor and Solana discord for everything that is undocumented (so everything) but I would love a bird's eye view of relationships between SPL/Serum and any potential protocol/service. You certainly need SPL for DeFi, but Project Serum surely just makes the process simpler?  


Scanning docs of protocols you really need to dig into them or the repo if public to see what they are using under the hood and hence hard to tell what their unique value proposition is and how they differ.   



 

Would you mind expanding on this bit?

&gt; code there is not following current practices. 


I know at some level one always needs to delegate trust and can't read all the source code, but guess overall I'm just curious about the intricacies of how a dev/DAO/company can bring out a product that really is only a front end that at the most complex fetches necessary accounts from another service.";0;2022-05-20 14:53:03;t3_uttqse;/r/solana/comments/uttqse/can_someone_tell_me_why_so_many_solana_defi/i9c3tii/

I'd like to give a shout out to Cogent Crypto Validator, not only are they a highly performing and reliable validator but I feel they go above and beyond what a validator offers to the wider network and Solana community, in the form of providing tools and articles to help others become a validator.
 
They have also created some very helpful guides on native and liquid staking to help those who are starting on their journey and are continuing to create tools for the community. 

On top of the above they are one of the only validators I know of that reward their stakers with the opportunity to own a part of the validator and its earnings with their Cogent Cog NFT's.

So please do keep Cogent in mind when you vote and feel free to join the discord for more info etc, great community on their.

Even then, I think if people are going to be trading leveraged positions on Solana, the devs should spend some extra time thinking about how to fairly get txs onto a block.

395;FunEarnings;Thank you for your response! BlazeStake uses the native stake pool from Solana, Marinade uses their own custom program, I think JPool uses the native stake pool with minor modifications to have a stake ceiling, and I'm not sure about the other pools. There's definitely a slight risk with staking using an on-chain program versus native staking, but it's very minimal risk especially if you're using the official stake pool program, which has several safeguards in place.;0;2022-05-18 05:20:33;t3_um44y4;/r/solana/comments/um44y4/blazestake_is_giving_away_05_sol_to_celebrate_the/i91h1rn/

400;7LayerMagikCookieBar;I'm not a dev so I can't audit the code myself but I can verify that FunEarnings is a dedicated community member who is very helpful and has been running the main public faucet for quite a while now as well. I know there is the native stake pool built into Solana but I'm not exactly sure if various stake pools modify any parts of that typically. I think Socean uses the native one as well  --- I'm not sure about Marinade and Lido. My understanding is that stake pools on all chains always have a bit more smart contract risk than native staking though. There are benefits to stake pools and staking derivatives that normal staking doesn't have though.;0;2022-05-18 03:39:53;t3_um44y4;/r/solana/comments/um44y4/blazestake_is_giving_away_05_sol_to_celebrate_the/i917fad/

489;ScientificBeastMode;"It’s super weird to me that many people in the Solana community think that Solana will succeed without any use of L2 chains for scaling purposes. It’s probably based on nothing but hubris, as if to say “we’re above all that, and thus we are better than Ethereum.”

That kind of thinking is just silly. If the Ethereum ecosystem is learning how to scale a slow system then Solana can and should steal those ideas for their own ecosystem.

In particular, zero-knowledge proof rollups (“ZK rollups”) seem very compelling for constraining the growth in execution time to a logarithmic function of transaction volume. With that specific technique, 100M transactions on Ethereum wouldn’t be that much more expensive than 10M transactions. If Solana can use that same technology, it would likely support absolutely *enormous* transaction volumes without any issues, and it would blow Ethereum’s capacity out of the water.

If Solana adopts an attitude of “anything Ethereum can do, Solana can do better,” then the sky is the limit for Solana. Is it faster than Ethereum now? Sure, but now is not the time to get complacent.";0;2022-05-17 02:31:14;t3_uqlffj;/r/solana/comments/uqlffj/not_a_fud_but_what_do_you_think_about_this_dd/i8weys7/

508;ZantetsuLastBlade2;"50K TPS was a benchmark of simple balance transfers.  Solana is believed to be capable of very high rates of balance transfers.  Testnet regularly does tens of K TPS of balance transfers during simulated testing.

Smart contracts are a very different kind of contract.  Because they can have highly variable resource usage, it's not easy or possible to say what the maximum TPS would be ""for smart contracts"".

No block chain that I am aware of benchmarks itself during ""smart contract execution"", they all basically report the best case of ""balance transfer TPS"".

Solana has a lot of improvement to do so that it can handle smart contract TPS better, for sure.

You can check out [Solana Compass](https://solanacompass.com/) or [Validators.App](https://www.validators.app/stake-pools?locale=en&amp;network=mainnet) to compare pools and their APY.

530;FunEarnings;"Hi there, we're the ones that run that faucet. There was a recent update to the Solana network a few days ago that placed a new restriction on accounts, requiring that all new Solana accounts are rent-exempt (have a minimum balance). For standard accounts, this balance is 0.00089088 SOL, and the account must never drop below that amount. If the account is a new account (0 SOL balance), a minimum deposit of 0.00089088 SOL must be made to activate the account.  
Our faucet gives away 0.00001 SOL per claim. This amount is less than the minimum amount required for rent exemption. We can't afford to pay everyone 0.00089088 SOL per claim, and paying that much per claim would lead to the faucet being drained easily.  
I'm guessing that you tried claiming from the faucet when your balance was 0 SOL. In this case, the faucet silently drops your transaction, since it can't be processed due to the new restrictions on the Solana network. We haven't gotten the chance to add a warning to the faucet page yet, as this new Solana feature is so new and we've had to quickly update our payments system first to ensure that we can still pay out the users who have a rent-exempt account.  
I apologize for the inconveniences, but I hope that you're able to get the amount of SOL you need. If you still need any help, please let me know, and I can send you the rent-exempt minimum amount to your address.";0;2022-05-16 14:53:05;t3_uqtnd6;/r/solana/comments/uqtnd6/solana_faucet_help/i8tqrks/
531;FunEarnings;Thanks for the mention! The new mandatory rent-exemption requirement means that the faucet no longer works for new Solana users (who don't have the minimum 0.00089088 SOL balance for rent-exemption since this feature was activated by Solana last epoch) but will continue to work for any accounts that still have a balance before this epoch or who have the minimum balance for rent-exemption.;0;2022-05-16 14:52:30;t3_uqtnd6;/r/solana/comments/uqtnd6/solana_faucet_help/i8tqony/

578;ZantetsuLastBlade2;"It's 22 because there are really only 22 independent operators above the halt line.  To be honest it will probably never be more than 22 given that there are 20 more validators just outside the top 24 who are clearly all the same operator.  Any stake movement that increases the halt set is just going to be bringing in more of that same operator, who will then have a more and more oversized influence on a potential halt.

That being said, Solana is not going to be halted by that set, any more than the top 22 richest people in the world are all just going to burn all of their money in a bonfire just for fun.";0;2022-05-15 22:14:27;t3_uq5jnh;/r/solana/comments/uq5jnh/how_solana_is_protecting_itself_from_the/i8qxyi9/
579;esaks;Nakamoto coefficient is a measurement of network decentralization. This number is the number of validators that need to collude to bring the network down.

580;ZantetsuLastBlade2;"To add to the complexity of the answer, validators 22, 23, and 24 are all pretty clearly the same operator (no proof, but they're all similar sized, they we all staked in a similar manner (in the same epochs), and they are all in AWS Tokyo), so really there are only 22 ""independent"" operators above the halt line.

Validators 25 through 41 look to be that same operator (all AWS nodes in Dublin or Tokyo, someone is dodging taxes and/or finance rules).  So realistically, Solana is not going to achieve Nakomoto Coefficient more than 22 for a very, very, VERY long time.

On the plus side, 2/3 of stake is more like 100 or so unique operators,  which is a decent number.  ""Two-thirds attack"" (the Proof of Stake equivalent of a Proof of Work 51% attack) looks to be incredibly unlikely with that number of nodes needing to cooperate.";0;2022-05-15 22:11:31;t3_uq5jnh;/r/solana/comments/uq5jnh/how_solana_is_protecting_itself_from_the/i8qxk90/

583;FunEarnings;"Hi there, we're the ones that run that faucet. There was a recent update to the Solana network a few days ago that placed a new restriction on accounts, requiring that all new Solana accounts are rent-exempt (have a minimum balance). For standard accounts, this balance is 0.00089088 SOL, and the account must never drop below that amount. If the account is a new account (0 SOL balance), a minimum deposit of 0.00089088 SOL must be made to activate the account.

Our faucet gives away 0.00001 SOL per claim. This amount is less than the minimum amount required for rent exemption. We can't afford to pay everyone 0.00089088 SOL per claim, and paying that much per claim would lead to the faucet being drained easily. 

I'm guessing that you tried claiming from the faucet when your balance was 0 SOL. In this case, the faucet silently drops your transaction, since it can't be processed due to the new restrictions on the Solana network. We haven't gotten the chance to add a warning to the faucet page yet, as this new Solana feature is so new and we've had to quickly update our payments system first to ensure that we can still pay out the users who have a rent-exempt account. 

I apologize for the inconveniences, but I hope that you're able to get the amount of SOL you need. If you still need any help, please let me know, and I can send you the rent-exempt minimum amount to your address.";0;2022-05-15 21:22:38;t3_uqewh4;/r/solana/comments/uqewh4/sol_faucet_not_working/i8qquk8/

602;lusotano;"The team has been working on stability issues since September. The main goal is to keep the speed/Tx/s without compromising the fees. Currently this is the biggest issue with L1s.

  
A lot of the Alt defi chains we saw this past bull run saw their fees increase substantially. If you tried them you would have noticed the fee market is the same way through most of them. It is fine while their footprint is small but if the ecosystem is to grow exponentially, so will these fees.

Currently is the chain that is competing in the NFT space. Having a spot in OpenSea, having some projects within the top 15. The deal to have the NFT's in Instagram means that it is slowly growing in that space as a competitor.

People say that Sol has the disadvantage of having Rust vs Solidity and therefore it cant take advantage of all the dapps built on Solidity. This is true, but something that is being worked on by Neon Labs as they raised 40 Million last November to build an EVM on Solana. Last update from the Neon Team puts that project in Alpha stage on the Testnet.

For the Ledger holders, it is currently the only chain that will allow you to do Defi through a cell using a ledger with the help of Solflare wallet. Might not matter to many, but people that dont do Cex/Hot wallets, this is a big plus.

It might fail during the bear, but normally during bear markets only the innovators survive by providing solutions to their user's problems.

612;ProsaicPansy;"Wouldn’t you also be pissed if your customers had to pay 10-100x higher fees than usual? Any application where the fees could exceed the value of the transaction is completely unworkable for MANY potential applications of web3. Extremely high fees is a de facto outage for 99% of potential future Web3 users.

Low, predictable fees and network stability are both highly desirable, but there hasn’t been a blockchain that has combined them successfully yet. Solana has the best chance of pulling it off, imo, although it’s far from a sure thing.";0;2022-05-15 14:40:24;t3_upp1no;/r/solana/comments/upp1no/this_is_why_solana_will_continue_being_a_top_10/i8p7zjr/
613;Current_North4661;"Thanks for the clarification.

But in the sense of censorship resistance can we say that if the government requested amazon to stop all Solana servers due to ""Monetary national security reasons""  They would be able to cut the energy to those validators even if they don't have access to the keys?

And as Amazon has 33% of the stake, that would cause the Solana network to stall right?

In that sense, I guess we still have a Nakamoto coefficient of 1.

I guess if something like that happened, it would be quite simple to change the validator position with your keys since what gives voting power to the validator are the keys, not the hardware, but still a metric worth improving in my opinion. 

I love the fact that you have a scoring system for this on your webpage, I've seen it before.

I wonder if it is possible to give this issue more visibility on Solana-related websites the majority of people use, like [solana.com](https://solana.com), or [solanabeach.com](https://solanabeach.com) because it's my perception that the more visible this is, the more likely we are to improve on that metric.

Self-criticism is what's likely to make this project successful, and this kind of problem requires either an incentive mechanism by Solana source code to disincentivize this behavior or community-driven improvements since the community owns the stake.

And since developers are focused on solving congestion issues, it seems a good idea to try this way until that is solved.";0;2022-05-15 14:19:45;t3_upwryh;/r/solana/comments/upwryh/i_think_we_should_give_more_visibility_to_this/i8p5ccu/

617;SolarCurve;"Solana has a server program that has four (4) different companies they recommend for hosting a Validator. [https://solana.foundation/server-program](https://solana.foundation/server-program)

The program is managed by [Inflect](https://inflect.com/) so that it's unbiased from Solana on where people end up. The participants are as follows:

1. [StackPath](https://www.stackpath.com/)
2. [Equinix](https://metal.equinix.com/)
3. [Lumen](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/edge-computing/bare-metal.html)
4. [Zen Layer](https://www.zenlayer.com/products/bare-metal-cloud/)

They care about decentralization quite a bit but as someone else pointed out in the thread, these companies are just infrastructure providers and they do not have access to the workloads or instances themselves. They do care also quite a lot about having Validators spread out into as many data centers as possible. 

It's important to note that those providers listed above have specific hardware dedicated to this program to make them the most efficient at providing these services with pre-negotiated rates. 

Lastly, if you're outside of the United States, you can apply for a Delegated Stake to help you get quickly to profitability on your node through the Solana Delegation program at [https://solana.foundation/delegation-program](https://solana.foundation/delegation-program)";0;2022-05-15 13:36:05;t3_upwryh;/r/solana/comments/upwryh/i_think_we_should_give_more_visibility_to_this/i8p01ua/

625;laine_sa;"Hey there,

data center and geographic decentralization are indeed important factors, but I want to clarify that validators to not ""pay those companies to manage their nodes"" in the sense that those hosting providers are providing only the hosting (hardware &amp; networking), the validators are still responsible and have exclusive access to the operating system and manage their cryptographic keys.

Almost all validators use data centers because of the requirements for Solana validators, notably the network requirements of min 1gbps up/down symmetric with no rate limiting or shaping.

On [stakewiz.com](https://stakewiz.com) we built a ranking score (Wiz Score) which calculates a percentage based score for each validator out of over a dozen metrics, three of which directly speak to what you are mentioning: ASN concentration (i.e. hosting provider, across all their locations), City concentration (validators in the same city, across multiple hosting providers) and City + ASN concentration (validators in the same city AND the same hosting provider).

Unfortunately AWS in particular is likely due to tax reasons as many of those are hosted with AWS in Dublin, Ireland, which is a tax friendly jurisdiction where many tech companies have their European HQ.";0;2022-05-15 09:45:54;t3_upwryh;/r/solana/comments/upwryh/i_think_we_should_give_more_visibility_to_this/i8ofzre/

Right now Solana rewards it's validators with inflationary staking rewards which constantly is increasing supply making SOL as a money hyper inflationary. The argument is you essentially outsource the validating to Ethereum and keep Solana as an app execution layer. The experience for an end user and developers building on Solana would remain the same. 

The downsides to this is Solana would be at the mercy of the Ethereum network. The big challenge for Toly and Solana labs is to reach escape velocity where the network itself can run stably and be profitable as to not devalue it's ""money"" sol with inflation. There are plans to adjust inflation rewards and developer activity and interest in Solana is great because of the performance of the network. I think they have a shot to make it work.

655;Working_Coat1459;"So you are basically saying solana is a fiat currency comparing it to the inner workings of fiat banking system. So long as they have too much tied up w/VCs, it opens itself up for attack just as Luna did. I agree, there may be something to it over time, but right now in beta, too early to tell…its not even close to Eth at this point which makes sense its still young but solana will never be an eth killer just as eth will not be the downfall of solana; both can exist if solana can get their security issues taken care of. The problem for sol will be the next solution coming out with even higher speeds and if it fails in the bear market, it could become another luna-they have a lot of pressure to make this right. So does ethereum, eth 2 or whatever it is called needs to be successful as well-should it not be successful, you may have a lot of issues in all crypto especially so tight to the luna issue. I hope solana fixes the issues but this isn’t the first reset and they still don’t have the solution, one can hope, I just don’t like to hope with my money, so I only have about 20% of what I had day solana crashed, played out well for me; if they straighten out their issues, I will be looking at adding more.";0;2022-05-14 22:11:58;t3_upp1no;/r/solana/comments/upp1no/this_is_why_solana_will_continue_being_a_top_10/i8mkban/

662;FunEarnings;"Best place to buy is probably KuCoin ([https://solfaucet.togatech.org/kucoin](https://solfaucet.togatech.org/kucoin)), they've always been fairly reliable for me and also don't require extensive KYC up to a certain limit so it's easier to get set up.

Best wallet to use is Phantom ([https://phantom.app/](https://phantom.app/)), it's super user-friendly and pretty intuitive. It's a browser extension, but you can also download as a mobile app (although the mobile app still has some bugs, so I would recommend just using the browser extension for now).

Best place to stake is with BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)), it's super beginner friendly and you can stake in just a few clicks. BlazeStake automatically spreads your stake across several validators, so you don't need to spend time choosing individual validators or doing extensive research on that, as BlazeStake will take care of all of that for you. Plus, when you stake with BlazeStake, there are some extra rewards that you'll get besides the baseline 5-6% standard APY, you'll be supporting the broader Solana ecosystem through the BlazeStake Treasury, and you'll also be helping with decentralization since your SOL will be staked with multiple validators. The stake pool program was [built by Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/) and [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three separate companies, plus the code is all [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code), so you can be sure your funds are safe when using the stake pool!";0;2022-05-14 21:30:39;t3_upq2iw;/r/solana/comments/upq2iw/best_place_to_buy_stake_solana_for_beginners/i8mez6v/

684;unvieledloki;"When will I start earning rewards?

When you decide to stake your Solana, you will need to initially wait for 2 epochs (where 1 epoch is roughly equivalent to 2-4 days) to start generating rewards. This means that if you start staking your SOL in epoch 100, then you will start earning rewards on the effective amount in epoch 102.

Your rewards are distributed every epoch after that.

Any additional SOL that you stake after will also need to wait for 2 epochs before earning rewards on the effective amount

694;Dutchmondo;"&gt;Final thoughts. We freely admit that our critique of proof of history and its use as a  
trusted source of time to improve the performance of proof-of-stake consensus is limited by  
a lack of information, even though we did our best to understand this issue by examining  
all of the available online articles and documentation for Solana (but not the source code).

TBH I feel that examining the source code should have been a much higher priority here. Victor has employed a lot of effort in producing this paper. Then at the end he admits that he suffered a lack of information, and he hasn't looked at the source code. Having read the available documentation, the source code will prove or disprove PoH and its performance. He openly admits this is a starting point. Maybe he's hoping someone else will review the code.";0;2022-05-14 15:52:22;t3_uozbi9;/r/solana/comments/uozbi9/proof_of_history_what_is_it_good_for/i8l6o47/

759;soggycheesestickjoos;"There’s a lot to learn.. (starting from the beginning because i don’t know your experience) I recommend looking at the difference in PoW and PoS blockchains, as bitcoin is PoW and other newer chains like solana are PoS. With that, also look into the capability to run smart contracts (called Programs on Solana) on the blockchain, which are essentially all the dApps and DeFi you’ll be seeing. Also, great thing to understand within the solana ecosystem is the spl token standard, with this provided, pretty much anybody can mint a new token or NFT within 30 minutes on Solana.

A lot of these features are things that are common to other chains like Cardano, NEAR, and even what Eth 2 is planning to be, but they’re all gonna do it a different way which is what leads to differing transaction and blockchain speeds, different gas costs, etc. which you can learn more about by doing research on any specific blockchain.";0;2022-05-13 19:25:51;t3_uoldzi;/r/solana/comments/uoldzi/why_is_solana_a_good_investment/i8hmyfj/

832;DavidKens;"&gt; classical DDOS still works

That’s my concern. Is this a deliberate tradeoff made by Solana? I don’t think all networks have this vulnerability, because they don’t have the node leader design?

833;DavidKens;"I’m not making a distinction between them. 

I see how adding a penalty for bad transactions can help things.  You potentially could have load balancers/firewalls filtering out incoming messages that are malformed (or maybe even from wallets with zero balance?), so that once the validator itself sees the message there’s some guarantee that it will be possible to punish the sender if the message is malicious. 

I think the point still stands that without the load balancers/firewalls, the validator machine is left to do all this filtering itself - and this filtering actually can be a huge amount of work. So much work, in fact, that there are still successful DDOS attacks on websites today which use such protections. 

My understanding of this is definitely simplistic, but I don’t think other networks have this vulnerability, because they don’t require that all messages be sent to a single leader? So eg in other networks validator nodes being flooded with messages can (I think?) just drop all incoming packets at a certain point, process the transactions they actually do have, and send the new block out to the rest of the network. Or something like that that? Whereas in Solana, the leader cannot do this?";0;2022-05-13 11:19:40;t3_uo50ii;/r/solana/comments/uo50ii/will_sol_survive/i8fs002/

860;7777777even;"Yes. Most major caps will survive one way or another. Regardless how you may feel about a certain alt coin and the tech aside, there are some powerful entities with list of $ to buy up proof of stake coins and run infrastructure for them. Take a look at any top market cap coin and you’ll notice the same entities running validators for them. Solana, Polygon, Near, Cosmos ecosystem (with 1 of the exceptions being Secret Network but many of the same entities are trying to find their way there too) Delegated proof of stake is easier for large entities and those with $ to manipulate than it is for say a PoW network like Monero and Bitcoin. Many look to Bitcoin for how alts move but I saw simply look at the top  validators across almost every major market cap coin and the entities behind them. 

So long as a network has users or either $ flowing in it’ll “survive.” Thrive is another question. The tech and fundamentals can give you the best information for the long term but it’s a free market and people buy all sorts of different coins for whatever different reasons. I would advise to stick to the tech and fundamentals as well as privacy/security coins/networks with strong tech and fundamentals.

862;FunEarnings;"Of course, and make sure you're staking with a stake pool like BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)) so that your stake is automatically spread out across multiple validators (increasing decentralization), plus with BlazeStake you'll earn extra rewards (optional airdrops and referral bonuses), and you'll be supporting smaller Solana ecosystem projects through the BlazeStake Treasury! 

BlazeStake just launched recently, but there is a launch giveaway at [https://twitter.com/solblaze\_org/status/1523802691171807232](https://twitter.com/solblaze_org/status/1523802691171807232) for people who stake at least 0.25 SOL with the pool. The pool program was [built by Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/) and [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three separate companies, plus the code is all [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code), so you can be sure your funds are safe when using the stake pool!";0;2022-05-13 03:41:10;t3_uogpft;/r/solana/comments/uogpft/it_is_the_right_time_to_stake_solana_and_support/i8eqbsh/
863;FunEarnings;"I totally understand your skepticism, especially with all the scams that are so pervasive in this space. BlazeStake is one of the safest stake pools out there, as the pool program was [built by Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/) and [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three separate companies, plus the code is all [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code), so you can be sure your funds are safe when using the stake pool! The pool program was designed in such a way that you always have full control over your funds (represented by the bSOL token, which is held non-custodially in your own wallet) and can always withdraw from the protocol at any time (converting the bSOL back to SOL), so everything is fully non-custodial and secure.

If you trust Solana Labs enough to hold money on Solana, then you can probably trust BlazeStake, since the program that actually handles all of the money was built by Solana Labs, many of the other components of the stake pool were built under the direct guidance of Solana Labs, and of course you can always look at [the code](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code). 

Furthermore, Solana Foundation is currently in the process of adding our stake pool to their official website (as they confirmed with us yesterday), and I can send you the details of how to access the corresponding page on the Solana Foundation website in a few days once their front-end developers finish adding everything, if that's something you want.

882;Mofatness;"What is SafeBridge?

After a successful launch of SafeBridge Testnet, we are now ready to move into production with SafeBridge Beta! SafeBridge is a fully functioning decentralized cryptocurrency bridge, a game-changing addition the Solana Ecosystem, and the backbone of the SafeCoin Ecosystem.

SafeBridge is a key DeFi component which will be utilized by our upcoming DEX - Safeswap. With the tranisition to SafeBridge Beta, SafeCoin can now offer limitless possibilities of secure blockchain interoperability for new and existing applications within the Solana and Safecoin Ecosystems. Projects and tokens can now be confidently built on the Safecoin blockchain by having seamless integration with other major networks. Using the security-centric SafeBridge, one now has the following capabilities:

- Fully functional migration of SAFE and ETH (native and tokens) across both chains
- Fully functional migration of SAFE and SOL (native and tokens) across both chains
- Upcoming chain integration with: BSC, AVAX, ADA

Furthermore, SafeBridge now opens many channels for which SafeCoin can be accessed. SafeCoin can now be listed on popular DEXs built on ETH and SOL such as (Uniswap, Raydium, Serum, etc.). Thus, allowing SafeCoin to branch out of its current ecosystem and establish itself in a larger community of cryptocurrencies.

A simplified flow chart of how SafeBridge, forked from Wormhole, is being integrated within the SafeCoin ecosystem (including SafeTrade) is shown here: https://imgur.com/a/4GwFtCM

Why SafeBridge?

Due to the recent bridge exploits which have occurred over the last few months, there is an immediate need for a robust and ""safe"" blockchain bridging platform. Wormhole, which blindly trusts the blockchains involved in the transaction, allowed 80,000wETH to be minted without any coins being deposited due to a bug in the Solana codebase. Contrast to this, SafeBridge ensures every swap is valid with additional check-stops to verify the circulating supply and balance of each transaction before and after minting. SafeBridge was developed to introduce additional checkpoints to mitigate the most dangerous security threat to have ever existed: human error.

How does it work?

SafeBridge will validate every swap with addition of check-stops which verify the circulating supply and balance of each transaction before and after minting. In addition to the security of the involved blockchains:

- SafeBridge will essentially add a two factor authenticator to double check the circulating supply at the start of the process and again just before the tokens are minted
- This ensures that no tokens are minted without locking and verifying the initial deposit

A basic flow diagram is illustrated here (https://imgur.com/a/WnMoILz) which highlights SafeBridge Beta functionality, with key additions in full SafeBridge with the green action circles.";0;2022-05-12 23:55:47;t3_uoediv;/r/solana/comments/uoediv/a_new_solana_bridge_has_been_released_which/i8dxod0/

1033;FunEarnings;"First off, good job to you for learning about cryptocurrencies and taking that initiative, you're probably more financially literate than most people your age!

Nobody really knows what will happen to the SOL price, and I'm not giving financial advice, but it's really up to your comfort levels. If you are scared of losing more money, then you might want to consider selling in case the price drops lower, but if you're okay with losing a bit of money in the short-term and taking a risk, you might want to consider holding in case the price recovers or even exceeds your initial investment (remember that SOL was once $250, so you could potentially turn a significant profit on your initial investment if SOL went back to $250), it's really up to you and what you're comfortable with doing.

One thing I would recommend doing if you're going to hold on to that SOL is to stake that SOL at BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)) to at least get a 5-6% APY on that SOL in a way that will allow you to instantly unstake and sell at any time if needed. With BlazeStake, your stake will automatically be spread among several validators to help strengthen the decentralization of the network and keep your rewards consistent, plus you’ll be able to participate in optional airdrops to increase those rewards, and you’ll be supporting smaller ecosystem projects through the BlazeStake Treasury.

BlazeStake just launched recently, but there is a launch giveaway at [https://twitter.com/solblaze\_org/status/1523802691171807232](https://twitter.com/solblaze_org/status/1523802691171807232) for people who stake at least 0.25 SOL with the pool. The pool program was [built by Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/) and [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three separate companies, plus the code is all [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code), so you can be sure your funds are safe when using the stake pool!

From there, you should be able to manage your staked funds on your Ledger through Phantom wallet by selecting the Ledger within the wallet.

I do believe that you would need to unstake to transfer your stake to another wallet like your Ledger, but I would highly recommend staking with BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)) after you unstake, as BlazeStake uses the liquid staking protocol that stores your stake as a token, making it easier to move around across wallets and unstake (the unstaking is instant). Plus, your stake is spread across several validators to increase decentralization and keep rewards consistent, you'll be able to participate in optional airdrops to get even more rewards, and you'll also be supporting smaller Solana ecosystem projects through the BlazeStake Treasury. 

BlazeStake just launched recently, but there is a launch giveaway at [https://twitter.com/solblaze\_org/status/1523802691171807232](https://twitter.com/solblaze_org/status/1523802691171807232) for people who stake at least 0.25 SOL with the pool. The pool program was [built by Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/) and [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three separate companies, plus the code is all [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code), so you can be sure your funds are safe when using the stake pool!

I sincerely hope that you'll consider staking a portion of your SOL with BlazeStake to help support the Solana network while also having an easier time transferring your stake if it's necessary in the future.";0;2022-05-11 20:23:23;t3_und707;/r/solana/comments/und707/staking_with_hardware_wallet/i88axnz/

1042;FunEarnings;"I would recommend staking your SOL with BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)) for the safest returns, there's no lockup period so you can withdraw at any time, and staking is something that functions on the protocol level of Solana so there's very little risk. There are a few reasons why you might want to stake your SOL with BlazeStake:

* You receive around 5-6% APY in rewards for staking your coins, which helps the network come to consensus and validate transactions (this is called Proof of Stake consensus)

1079;FunEarnings;"It's normal depending on when you unstake. The 2-3 days delay is based on the time it takes for the 2-3 day epoch to complete, so depending on when you unstake during an epoch, it might be faster or slower to deactivate the stake. The epoch ends in around 15 hours (see [explorer.solana.com](https://explorer.solana.com)), so the stake should be fully deactivated by then.

By the way, if you want to avoid stake/unstake delays (you'll be missing out on rewards for several days with these delays) while helping keep the network decentralized, please consider staking a portion of your SOL with a liquid stake pool like BlazeStake ([stake.solblaze.org](https://stake.solblaze.org)). Cogent Crypto gets the most stake from the pool, so a lot of your stake will still go to Cogent Crypto.

I was offered so many golden tickets out of the the country by friends, family and my clients - I refused. My future wife also refused to flee, wanting to fight in the army if she must. This is real. even old ladies are taking lessons on how to operate the AK-47 and AK-74. I seen it myself. 

My city was hit already a few times by cruise missiles but life must go on. My future brother volunteered to fight in the war so Europe, especially the parts that were once in the Warsaw Pact, don't have to deal with Russia directly!  The genocide, rape, children being shot and refugee situation is real. I see the suffering everyday. I had American friends literally running for their lives and one had to abandon his dream home that he built in central Ukraine where he could enjoy a quiet life. It was taken over by the Russians who destroyed it. 

Some of these comments are sickening and I really hope MSM doesn't catch wind of this. If this was 1939 Already MSM in Norway and America not only think crypto and NFTs are a scam but also a tool used by the Russians, North Koreans and Iranians  to get around sanctions.

1219;Nathan-Stubblefield;"There is nothing about the outages or slowdown that can’t be explained and prevented with coding that is in development. The outages are a consequence of the tiny transaction fee, $0.00025 per transaction, and the practice of using bots to place bids a million times or so per second when NFTs go on sale. Solana could presently handle 50,000 transactions per second. A further complication is that the bids can overload the memory of the computers used by validators, without even proceeding to a transaction fee. The developers are introducing measures to limit this practice to a rate the system can handle.

Staking is still the best way to help decentralize Solana, and earn passively. Check out how you can earn some extra MNDE on the [marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance) website if you're holding mSOL.

Or if you're staked manually, it's time to explore your validator, which is likely hosted by some upstanding community members, and maybe some friends you have yet to meet. 😁";0;2022-05-09 14:39:21;t3_ulh7b6;/r/solana/comments/ulh7b6/weekly_thread_may_9_2022/i7xafk1/

1234;Brilliant-Writer-677;So update, crypto.com says they can recover the funds. For a $150 fee!!!!! I'm so sad about this. So far my experience, I can't use my chase debit card (the only card I have) to get Solana on moonpay, which would be the easiest route, the exchanges will charge you extremely high fee if they decide to take on the problem, I've learned there is no information out there on transferring to and from certain exchanges, and WSOL shouldn't exist, because every thread I read on WSOL is filled with transfer problems. FTX.US will hold your funds for almost 12 days before you, withdraw or swap, voyager does the same. The sad part they're holding $300 and $250 such small amount. It's ridiculous wants the point of Plaid payment system if I have to wait that many days for a transaction to complete. It has been a struggle getting started on Solana to say the least. I was able to get 1 SOL into my Phantom account after days of trying.  It's frustrating, sorry for ranting. I still believe in the space, I'm just upset that has been so difficult to get into Solana.;0;2022-05-09 12:55:50;t3_ujkmc5;/r/solana/comments/ujkmc5/wsol_stuck_in_my_coinbase_wallet/i7wwvg0/

1311;FunEarnings;"There are a bunch of unique features in the BlazeStake pool that aren't present in Marinade:

* Public referral program (Marinade's referral program is only open to protocols and wallets)
* Use of official Solana Labs stake pool programs (Marinade is not using the official programs)
* Open source from day 1 (not the case for Marinade)
* Airdrops system for increased rewards (in development, not in any other stake pool)
* Treasury system for supporting smaller Solana ecosystem projects (in development, not in most other stake pools)

Also, having more stake pools is better for network decentralization, because not only is distributing stake across validators important, but distributing stake across stake pools is also important to ensure that no single stake pool has control of too much stake for delegation. 

We hope that you'll consider staking a portion of your SOL at our stake pool to help with the decentralization of the network while supporting smaller Solana ecosystem projects!";0;2022-05-08 06:26:11;t3_ukjvgs;/r/solana/comments/ukjvgs/heres_why_you_should_stake_your_sol_at_the/i7rpp7i/

1321;FunEarnings;"First off, I totally understand your concern, but I want to say a few things to reassure you.

Our code is completely [open-source](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/developers/open-source-code), the programs were created under the guidance of [Solana Labs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/stake-pool/), and the programs have been [audited](https://stake-docs.solblaze.org/protocol/audits) by three separate auditing firms, so you can be sure that your funds are always secure.

Of course, if you're not comfortable with staking with us since we're newer, that's totally understandable, but do note that the stake pool contracts we use have been used for months and currently secure tens of millions of dollars.

We highly encourage stake pool decentralization as well (ensuring that one stake pool does not dominate too much and gain too much control over where funds are staked), so we would encourage you to consider splitting your stake and staking some of that SOL with BlazeStake to help out smaller stake pools, but of course it is totally up to you and your level of comfort with interacting with our protocol.";0;2022-05-08 00:41:50;t3_ukjvgs;/r/solana/comments/ukjvgs/heres_why_you_should_stake_your_sol_at_the/i7qpykd/
1322;FunEarnings;We do indeed use the universal staking code which was created under the guidance of Solana Labs and audited by three organizations (see the links in the comment you replied to).

The JavaScript bindings were developed in partnership with JPool under the guidance of Solana Labs and heavily tested both by us and by Solana Labs. The SDK and front-end interface have been tested by several validators and serve mainly as a way to interact with the programs that actually handle the stake (the ones which have been audited and heavily tested).;0;2022-05-08 00:36:54;t3_ukjvgs;/r/solana/comments/ukjvgs/heres_why_you_should_stake_your_sol_at_the/i7qpe7h/

Wow, stake based priority will suck.  It means you need a validator to submit transactions which means my tx will have to do multiple hops to get to the leader.  If you dont't want to spend 2000 bucks a month on a validator, you will just have to trust someone is going to relay your tx without front running you.  Given competitive nfts and the number of arb funds trading on Solana, I am nervous that this will be the case.

Why can't the devs just do tx submission by fee only?  And just have a reputation system for quic clients?  I don't want to run a full validator just to submit txs.  And how many peers will a leader be able to have?  Not everyone is going to be able to connect to the leader.

1389;lwc-wtang12;"Not nearly as many times as solana, not in the same way that solana has, or for how long solana has. Why? Because ethereum doesn't sacrifice security or decentralization for the sake of scalability. Any blockchain can make the node hardware requirements super high and jack up throughput, but that sacrifices decentralization and security. 

Solana just has huge hardware requirements and lets the block creator verify the block instead of all nodes agreeing. This makes tps super fast obviously, but then you have major issues. 

There's a reason researchers and devs on all major projects agree that sidechains, sharding, rollups, etc. are the best methods for scaling blockchains. 

It's because the main chain remains secure and decentralized, which should be the largest priority. Otherwise, this whole cryptocurrency experiment that's been going on since bitcoin has accomplished nothing and we're just buying a coins operated by some random private company.";0;2022-05-06 20:27:38;t3_ujivfz;/r/solana/comments/ujivfz/eth_vs_sol_i_just_saw_this_from_cryptocrunchapp/i7lilip/

1431;Neekoki;"Great question. I haven’t used the new Dexlab UI much bust since you were able to populate the fields, then you must have found your way around.
In order to use it you will need a wallet connected to the site. You can download the (most popular and highly recommended) Phantom wallet as a chrome extension or mobile app. 
After setting your wallet up, you will need funds in there to post orders. 
It’s quick and easy to connect the wallet. Then launch dexlab in the phantom app browser. If you’re on desktop, then when you select phantom from the wallet menu on the site, it will automatically open the phantom extension.
Try it out. You’ll have to play around a bit to figure out how it works but usually when you submit a transaction, phantom will display an approve button. When clicked, your order is processing.
After an order is completed it will be added to the buy/sell order spread. After the order is filled, the funds may not appear in your wallet automatically. (It is there, you just need to find the button that says settle, and settle funds

Since dexlab has a wallet now you can probably use that option as well, but I still recommend phantom because you can use it with any solana dex";0;2022-05-06 14:25:21;t3_pik4w2;/r/solana/comments/pik4w2/can_someone_explain_how_this_interface_works/i7k3k9h/

1460;dingus-pendamus;"Solana, unlike Bitcoin, allows people to trade.  With people trading, I want to a avoid front running.  

Solana, according to another Reddit thread, avoids front running by letting traders submit transactions directly to the leader (one hop). If staked validators become the only way to submit transactions, then you are looking at multiple hops to the leader in which someone can front run you or blackhole your transaction.

I don’t see how a p2p system can work with Solana’s current topology of everyone connecting to a single leader.  I suspect Solana will evolve to a more traditional p2p network with a transaction mempool.  Not everyone will be able to connect to the leader.";0;2022-05-06 06:49:55;t3_uj6rxl;/r/solana/comments/uj6rxl/okso_is_solana_the_real_deal_very_curious_about/i7ixzo5/
1461;JaggerFoo;"From a development perspective it's not a platform I would bet on near term - too many issues right now. It's like living in a place where random water and electrical outages occur.

I'll hold the small amout of SOL I have in case I need to work with Solana or Metaplex. Having Rust to work with is not fun, even though I am familiar with it enough to dive in if needed.

I started out wanting to develop on Solana and didn't know much about Ethereum and avoided it because of what I read about the cost differences, but I ended up liking the Ethereum ecosystem more despite the higher transaction cost.

The Ethereum ecosystem is big and rich with financial capital, technical innovation, community, etc. that I don't see Solana catching up soon. I read that a Solana project is working on EVM compatibility. 

VC money is looking to invest on good ideas, so Solana projects should survive.

1471;eth2five;"The challenge with all these newer ALTS is they are copy a good idea and then attempt to “improve“ it. As though the shortcomings of the original were an easy fix and the creators /devs were just not as clever/insightful/well funded. 

Then you add in a whole group of “investors” who missed the early days of crypto, and want to turn their $1000 into a $1M, so are emotionally blinded because of their they need to believe they are in early, that they were insightful for doing so and no other project can compete (which affirms their skill in choosing it and that they haven’t missed the crypto gold rush)

It’s all absolutely a replica of the existing financial industry. See someone make money with a good idea, repeat it, only fine tune it to make the most money for creators and use retail money to fund it.

When you see the emotional responses on any of these forums the real crux is people believing they have picked the newer better BTC, ETH or whatever, and so any rational criticism is a direct attack on their insight and financial commitment/outcome. 

It doesn’t mean you can make money out of it, just people need to be more realistic. 

Solana is an ETH clone, constructed to concentrate wealth with the founders, tripping over all the hurdles on their development path, because it turns out it’s not that simple after all….

It’s only in BETA though, so I’m sure when the first production release is confirmed, it’ll go to the moon and how silly will all those BTC and ETH holders look then.";0;2022-05-06 04:39:48;t3_uj6rxl;/r/solana/comments/uj6rxl/okso_is_solana_the_real_deal_very_curious_about/i7in3m5/

Besides that, there are inumerous protocols that are being built on the network, leveraging its composability to a whole new level. Everlend, [margin.fi](https://margin.fi), [juiced.fi](https://juiced.fi), and a whole kinda of product that can abuse the network low fees and monolithic architecture, moving funds around and providing liquidity in a capital efficient way.

1499;Mediocre_Piccolo8542;"Sorry, bad wording on my side. I should say no stress testing on live net with real money, but it should be done on separated developer test net.

Yes, it would work to manually ban certain IPs/Wallet addresses or rise their fees, but the adversary could also avoid it with getting new IPs/wallets which would eventually lead to some constant catching up with bad players, which isn’t ideal.

 Then the question how many tps are too much, and who decided to ban it, there are also legitimate cases for many transactions, it’s the selling point of Solana after all. Sure, they could approve certain addresses as “legitimate” but that would be a a case censorship after all. One of the core ideas of blockchain is that everyone is treated equally.

In my opinion they should do it on protocol level with some sort of tiered pricing for people who really use a lot of throughput of the network and need it could pay simply more, while standard price would be low and offer less throughput, but it will be still more than enough for normal person. Then maybe adding some reputation system where older addresses with clean track record would be treated differently than brand new addresses sending a lot of transactions.

My point is basically to do it on protocol level and find a balance where the cost of higher fees and setting up new addresses will be higher than profits from spam attacks. I am not a fan of manually banning some addresses based on arbitrary decisions made by humans, it’s not as effective and has a taste of censorship";0;2022-05-05 20:28:50;t3_uhbzj9;/r/solana/comments/uhbzj9/some_friendly_comedic_banter_from_the_algorand/i7gyjm2/

1529;Signal_Ad657;It’s tough, Solana is a legit startup in many ways.  Bitcoin and Ethereum are not at all perfect, but have stood the test of time and have a lot of maturity to them as projects.  Solana is still breaking stuff and fixing it all the time, which makes it a bit edgier and more volatile of an investment.  I think in three years Solana can represent 10% of the total crypto market, and in five years 15%.  That would be roughly a 5x-7.5x return over the next five years with no further growth in crypto at large.  If you assumed that crypto would triple in size from here over the next five years, that would become a 15x-22.5x return over the next five years.  Solana keeps hitting important milestones, attracting big investors, and is smartly using capital to be a front runner in block chain programming and use case competitions and development programs.  They already have a lot of momentum and strong things going for them, and can outspend major rivals ten to one over the next decade.  That’s tough to contend with.  They’ll be a real force for a very long time and I don’t see anyone stopping them in the long run.  The number one threat to Solana as I see it, isn’t any current L1, it’s some crazy L1 that we haven’t seen yet that could be built by one of the giant tech companies at a later date.;0;2022-05-05 10:05:40;t3_uiruih;/r/solana/comments/uiruih/sell_me_on_solana/i7eom3u/

1548;dernthecern;"Awesome!  Yeah, first things first, when the artist finishes creating the mosaic, the mosaic is minted as a typical Solana NFT that can be bought and sold like any other Solana NFT.    


The difference is that I have additional infrastructure on Solana that allows the artist to digitally create the mosaic in the first place, and basically provides a verification that the artist placed all the particular cubes at each particular location.    


The resulting NFT simply contains an image of the final mosaic, but its metadata points back to interface where you can see the 3D mosaic in all of its glory (like the above video of Mario).  In owning the NFT, you are therefore ""owning"" the result of the vision, time, and effort the artist put in to creating the piece (so it's more like owning the Mona Lisa than just owning a jpeg).     


I'm currently in the process of verifying that all of this works on devnet, but once that goes through I'll finally be able to start actually creating mosaics (and anyone else can too!).

1553;Junnowhoitis;Well it's basically impossible for solana to stop fake nfts from being created. The reason is you upload the image to ipfs or equivalent than Link the Metadata to the images online location than create the token tied to the Metadata. The network doesn't have the ability to check for plagiarism since it doesn't have control of the uploads and theres too many nfts created to do them manually. In some cases there will be reports and bans from secondary market places, groups, and wallets blacklisted but that's about the max extent of the situation and is extremely rare for any action to happen.

1565;artica_james;You would be best to get yourself something like Phantom Wallet and stake directly with 1-3 validators within the wallet. This means you will own the keys to your Solana and help with the decentralization of the network rather than staking with an exchange, plus you'll get much better returns. Have a look at [stakewiz.com](https://stakewiz.com), which is a really great tool to help you find validators. My personal recommendation would be Cogent Crypto, they consistently offer the best returns, are super reliable and have a very helpful discord community. This article would be a beneficial read to help you with your staking journey, hope this helps :) https://medium.com/@Cogent\_Crypto/solana-staking-guide-part-1-6a6a85f07b56;0;2022-05-04 20:55:44;t3_uidvcl;/r/solana/comments/uidvcl/staking_sol_on_gemini_or_standard_custody_and/i7cavun/
1566;EchoMental3478;They are planning to limit the writing to an account. Solana stores code / smart contracts in accounts on the chain. This planned limit prevents the spamming of specific smart contracts while other transactions for other smart contracts get through and are executed. For example: bot spamming to grab an specific nft mint. This limit prevents that this spamming leads to an outtage of the whole chain. At least this is my understanding.;0;2022-05-04 20:50:15;t3_uifwuw;/r/solana/comments/uifwuw/solana_neighborhood_fees/i7ca12b/
1567;fight_the_hate;"I believe getting off coinbase and staking directly in a wallet is your best long term hold.

The Solana network needs help decentralizing it's validators. When you stake on a CEX the power is being centralized because they own a top validator.

If you check out marinade.finance you'll find a way to easily stake, and also help decentralize the network. Additionally, if you take a look at the DEFI tab on the website you'll see that you can reinvest mSOL, giving you even better passive returns.";0;2022-05-04 20:35:08;t3_uidvcl;/r/solana/comments/uidvcl/staking_sol_on_gemini_or_standard_custody_and/i7c7p1u/

1615;iglootyler;"Interesting. You would think since a Blockchain is essentially a network (correct me if I'm wrong there) you could somehow implement a type of quailty of service where IPs are given certain priorities. If you see an IP with hundreds of thousands of tx you raise fees to mitigate is that essentially the idea? Again I'm no cryptographer or developer just trying to learn more about Solana.

Your last sentence and first sentence are a little contradictory (no offense). I guess there are applications that run on testnets to simulate loads of txs?  That's the type of ""stress test"" I'm referring to.

1616;Boss_BrownSugar;"Hey, Welcome to Solana♥️
1. You can Solana through any reputable dex, FTX, Coinbase, Huobi, Binance etc It's one of the most dominant chains, it's going to be hard for you to NOT find it

2. Any stable coin works, if you are buying on a dex and for some obscure reason, your chosen stable coin isn't trading with it, you can always trade to a stablecoin that does and buy with that.

3. Short answer, No. You will need Solana wallets like phantom, slope, solflare etc

4. Yea, Sol is staked safely. There are lots of defi that do that but the best way is liquid staking with Marinade.finance. it will give you a tokenized version of your stake with 6% apy called mSol which you can stake again on Orca, Raydium etc for more apy. They delegate to hundreds of validators so you will be decentralizing the block chain too.

If you have any questions, please ask!";0;2022-05-04 09:35:28;t3_uhrnzb;/r/solana/comments/uhrnzb/how_to_buy_solana/i79tdkj/

Solana achieves better metrics and better commercialization so far, but counterpoint is lack of trust after several outages with another irregularities. Both have quite VC’s and insiders oriented tokenomics which is a disadvantage for retail, yet algorand has a flawless track record being honest about it and zero outages so far. However, Solana has been overall the more profitable investment for early retail investors by far, while Algorand early investors had  much less profits.

2. you can swap in multiple ways so it's not too important which stablecoin you use.
3.  Metamask is not compatible, but you can transfer assets to Solana using wormhole
4. The easiest way to stake is to head to [marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance) and stake. The staking APY is around 6% no matter what method you choose. This service gives you mSOL in exchange for staking your SOL to over 400+ validators.

1638;Nomadux;"Solana's entire existence is only a couple of years old. I know a lot of people in this space are wildly uninformed and make terrible financial decisions, but that is not the developer's fault. Their only job is to improve the blockchain. 

The reality is everyone who has bought Solana has done so at a discount in regards to what the developers have promised. The reason that has occurred is, because of the risk that those promises aren't fulfilled. If they were to be fulfilled, then the price will go up. This is how new (businesses, crypto, etc.) all work. If you're that impatient, then I'd recommend focusing on less innovative products and services.";0;2022-05-04 00:56:05;t3_ug09ze;/r/solana/comments/ug09ze/solana_restarted_after_sevenhour_outage_caused_by/i78ehbq/

The trend appears to be that whenever an alt comes into the space with some killer feature, eventually that feature makes its way to the bitcoin ecosystem and then it just obsoletes the alt because bitcoin has the network effect and the brand.

1709;dingus-pendamus;"Like I mentioned in another thread, the TPU setup is really bad.  Validators can't kick out peers that misbehave.  

From the tx sender perspective, you get no feedback when you submit a tx, no ack, no success or fail.  You have to send your tx until you either give up or a validator publishes your a block with your tx.  Since everyone is competing to get their tx in first when a nft mint starts, game theory says to max send txs over UDP to the leader.  This is in effect a DDOS of the Solana network.

To fix this, the devs need to implement a p2p handshake to enforce good behavior.  However, I speculate this will lead to a defacto mempool, or force users to pay a staked-validator for direct access. 

Someone in another thread said the devs didn't implement a mempool b/c the devs were scared of front running.  But because of this design choice, it is very hard to throttle tx submissions. I hope there is some protocol change that allows for a mempool without front running.";0;2022-05-03 04:09:56;t3_ugzh6q;/r/solana/comments/ugzh6q/bots_swarm_candy_machine_nft_minting_tool_leading/i74br3b/

1721;ZantetsuLastBlade2;"What's the end-to-end time on a transaction?  That's what really matters.  It's an honest question.  I'd like to understand the factors that affect how long it takes from user submitting transaction, to transaction landing on chain, to results being available to the transaction submitter.  All factors matter, and it's easy to obfuscate by talking about only part of the process.

I am not claiming that Algorand is obfuscating, but no one has ever been able to answer the above question for me and I'd really just like an honest answer!

For Solana, the user submits tx to RPC and then RPC submits directly to leader.  Leader includes the tx on chain, validators vote, and then tx goes through an ""optimistic confirmation"" process where the user can choose how many confirmations they want to wait for before assuming finality.  32 confirmations is complete finality, 1 confirmation is least complete, and the chances of rollback become exponentially smaller the more confirmations there are.

A user can bypass RPC nodes with sophisticated software so the minimum latencies involved are:

(-) Time to submit tx to leader (minimal)
(-) Time for leader's block to complete (up to 500 or so ms)
(-) Time for confirmations: theoretically N * 500 ms, so from 500 ms to 16 seconds depending on desired confirmation level;  but in practice right now confirmations are slow because the network isn't working that well, so it's alot closer to a dozen or more seconds in almost all cases.

Keep in mind also that I'm talking about real smart contract execution transactions, not just balance transfers.

If Solana were facing a load like Algorand faces for smart contracts - a few per second? - it would be breezing along and achieving very close to its maximum possible performance, so overall transaction completion time - end to end - would be alot closer to under 2 seconds, up to 16 seconds, depending on desired finality confidence.

Maybe Algorand is faster than that?  I'm not sure, but I'd like to know the real details instead of just picking up somewhere close to the end (after the network already has the transaction in question and is performing its final consensus operations on it).";0;2022-05-02 21:53:50;t3_ug6rz3;/r/solana/comments/ug6rz3/if_solana_is_so_scalable_why_does_it_have_so_many/i72yoom/

1736;dernthecern;"Yeah, so the interface allows you to create a rubiks cube mosaic by solving a cube and adding it to the mosaic (see [www.cubeduniverse.com/demo](https://www.cubeduniverse.com/demo)).   The info about a particular canvas is stored on Solana.  Each cube placed in the mosaic is also kept track of using Solana.  When you finish a mosaic, an associated NFT is created that contains an image of the mosaic, and points back to this interface which shows the mosaic solving itself.  


Basically, each mosaic is not only a piece of art, but also a *proof* of the process required to create the mosaic, which I think is a cool accomplishment.  


I also made the mosaic creation process easier by creating a cube that solves itself (see the demo -- click any two stickers, and the cube will solve itself so that the first sticker goes to where the second sticker currently is).  I'll have a better demo for this out in a bit if you're interested.  


In general, I was interested in the idea of NFT art with greater intrinsic value.   And if anyone can see a proof of the time and effort needed to create a cool piece of art, then it seems like the art itself is actually more than \*just a jpeg\* :)";0;2022-05-02 18:52:14;t3_uguxvw;/r/solana/comments/uguxvw/rubiks_cube_mario_that_solves_itself_on_solana/i7287ce/

Ignore them and don't grant ANY permissions to the scam coins so you don't have to keep wasting money by transferring your assets to new wallets. 
   
Follow my steps below to protect yourself from assholes.     
   

Create a new wallet for scam coins and questionable airdrops. When you find a new coin in your wallet, attempt to transfer the newcomer to your scam wallet. If it doesn't allow you to transfer, you found out its a scam coin without granting the exploiter any permissions in your wallet. 
If it allows you to transfer, albeit for an INSANE transaction fee, it's a scam coin.

It's also taking the approach of live testing rather than testing code a in a lab environment like some other chains.";0;2022-05-02 12:07:41;t3_ug6rz3;/r/solana/comments/ug6rz3/if_solana_is_so_scalable_why_does_it_have_so_many/i70ocds/

Tldr: Fixing p2p behavior and tx capacity rationing leads to front running.


Quic solves one problem and creates another.  Not everyone will be able to peer with the leader.  So the devs have to pick who can connect.  If they just pick a hand full of core people, then those core people will be able to front run everyone.  Then you will have insiders grabbing nft mints and liquidating people on dexs. Discord chats by devs indicate they are leaning towards prioritizing staked-voting validators, IP addresses, and filtering wallet public keys 

On top of quic, devs have to implement a fee market, or else they will be spammed to death anyway.

Lastly, devs don't have time to wait.  Ddos costs maybe 100 USD an hour to bring tps to 100.  Given nft mints net several thousand dollars in a few minutes, game theory says it pays to DDOS Solana to win.";0;2022-05-02 04:17:17;t3_ug6rz3;/r/solana/comments/ug6rz3/if_solana_is_so_scalable_why_does_it_have_so_many/i6znrwm/

1831;Zorbithia;How'd you even manage to send them to a coinbase address in the first place?

1832;GiannisIsaGreekZaza;I’ve recently entered into defi. I like solana best so far after using other chains. Just works the fastest and the fees matter for my smaller transactions. Basically impossible to make any money in defi on eth even layer 2s which may have .50-1$ in transaction costs.;0;2022-05-02 00:20:15;t3_ug65jn;/r/solana/comments/ug65jn/what_do_you_think/i6yxaru/
1833;Zorbithia;"Yes, use [jup.ag](https://jup.ag) or [prism.ag](https://prism.ag) \- both are aggregators that will find the best routes for your swap and automatically list them by order from most money returned to least.  

Keep in mind that on these, if there are weird token swaps (like going from something a bit more exotic and uncommon than SOL -&gt; USDC or the reverse, say, going from Wormhole MATIC token to USDT \[Solana SPL token version\]), then it's going to route the transaction through a bunch of different pools to make that swap possible and this means that your transaction can run the risk of timing out randomly, which means you'll have to re-try it.

This happens because the Solana network has been shit lately on top of it being limited in terms of the size/amount of instructions (units) able to be included in a transaction, and it's already at the level of where some of the pretty basic operations done on some Solana DeFi apps are just barely managing to stay under that limit. 

 Jupiter and PRISM both have worked to alleviate this issue by splitting the transaction into 2 or even 3 different parts if this happens to be the case for you.  This usually only happens if for whatever reason their aggregation engines have found a higher total return on a swap, but one that routes your transaction through several LPs/token pairs instead of using something like the actual LP for say, SOL &lt;&gt; USDC in the OPs case.  

So if it says that you're swapping SOL into USDC and the expected return from 1 SOL is 90.1 USDC with the top listing, and 89.9 USDC in the second listing -- it might be worth it to actually choose the second listing if you are worried about the transaction failing, that's a choice that is going to be personal for each user...if the whole transaction isn't confirmed/finished within a period of time (less than \~30 seconds, if I remember correctly)

Finally, when a transaction is routed through a lot of LPs, like say it goes from SOL &gt; USDT &gt; mSOL &gt; USDC if you don't already have the associated token accounts/serum accounts in your wallet for those tokens - which each cost a rent fee of 0.02 or so SOL, you'll be charged for them in the transaction.  Do note that you can close these associated token accounts for these cases and any other unused accounts that you have 0 balance on, to recoup some of the costs, by using a site that has this feature like [Sonar.watch](https://Sonar.watch) which is linked to from the Jupiter site (on that little wrench icon).";0;2022-05-02 00:15:21;t3_ufo9af;/r/solana/comments/ufo9af/need_a_popular_swap_for_solana/i6ywpbi/

1837;Zorbithia;"Since no one else is going to answer you (there's like 10 of these threads per day) I'll just go ahead and do it, so I can reference this post in the future by copy/pasting it when the need arises.

1) You fund your solana wallet by purchasing SOL at an exchange like Coinbase, Kucoin, Binance, FTX etc.  You'll have to install a Solana wallet on your computer, get the Phantom wallet extension or the Solflare one, they are IMHO the two best Solana wallets.  Set up your wallet, make sure you keep your secret recovery phrase and details written down someplace safe and secure in case you need it and never ever share it with anyone, ever.  It's a pretty self-explanatory thing of purchasing SOL on an exchange and sending it, just copy/paste your SOL wallet address on Coinbase or whatever as the wallet to withdraw to.

2) For Arweave, you'll need AR.  A little AR goes a long way, arweave is pretty cheap though if you are uploading thousands or 10k different files, it might add up a little bit.  AR tokens can be bought on Binance, Kucoin and a few other places.  Same situation as with your Solana wallet - I would recommend installing the ARconnect extension (in Brave/Chrome) for this, it's my favorite Arweave wallet. 

Arweave is a totally separate network/blockchain that Solana is.  You will need to use the two separate wallets because of this, there's no way to currently switch or transfer one for the other as you asked.";0;2022-05-01 23:57:58;t3_ug19c7;/r/solana/comments/ug19c7/hi_guys_i_have_questions_regarding_solana_nft/i6yum86/

1861;Burchanold;"Let me use this as an example

Your exchange has its network. It's all subject to its speeds and the way it works. When you buy SOL and leave it, it stays on that network.

Now when you try to move it to another wallet, exchange, etc. It has to make a transaction to the Solana network. Normally exchanges will take batches of transactions and push them through at certain times. So, when you buy SOL, and try to move it to your wallet then you're subject to the exchanges system. If they do the same and do batch transactions, then you'll have to wait until that batch you're grouoed in gets transferred. Once it on the Solana network then it will have the speed and cost of the Solana network (usually within a few minutes, and less than a penny for the majority of transactions).";0;2022-05-01 20:15:09;t3_ug06go;/r/solana/comments/ug06go/its_been_4_hours_now/i6y1g04/

If you have a beta chain you shouldn't allow people to but billions of dollars there, we have testnets for beta.;0;2022-05-01 19:38:26;t3_ufqtus;/r/solana/comments/ufqtus/validators_are_back_online/i6xwcpz/

1870;discrete_moment;"Yeah, I get you.

The issue here is essentially UDP, which was chosen when Solana was designed, and nobody knew how the NFT thing would play out. A solution has been in the works since a couple months back, but it’s not online yet.

You could argue they should have predicted this problem. And perhaps they should have. But it’s often not easy to do.";0;2022-05-01 19:16:30;t3_ug09ze;/r/solana/comments/ug09ze/solana_restarted_after_sevenhour_outage_caused_by/i6xt9qq/
1871;EchoMental3478;"Solana is a victim of its own success. The problems are annoying and understand the frustration. But you have to consider the context: other chains still have to proof that they can handle the amount of traffic solana does on a regular day. These ""outtages"" are growing pains, nothing is fundamentally broken. 

The bot spamming needs to be adressed  as fast as possible. The good news: the validator community and solana labs are working on it and from my understanding they just need more time. I recommend the solana discord channel for the technical details.

“Scalable” doesn’t mean “robust with respect to outages”.  You can only scale so much—there will always be some limit—and when you hit that limit the “failure” should be graceful, and obviously Solana isn’t there yet.

Idk if 2 - 3 outages for something that is sort of in Beta is really enough to gauge longterm success or failure probabilities though.

1935;benny_breeg;Because of Solana's deliberate policy of fixed transaction fees regardless of the number of submitted transactions. This feature is very user friendly as you don't even have to look at the transaction fee when using Solana, but it has issues in its current form.  It caused the validators to lose consensus as to the current state of the network. Validators not agreeing isn't so much a decentralisation issue as a bug in the software they are running. Ethereum doesn't have this issue as it only processes 15 transactions per second and sends transaction fees to the moon in order to keep the transactions at 15 per second.  In order for validators to regain consensus, you have to go back in time to a previous block where consensus was maintained among validators and restart it from there. They aren't joking when they call it 'mainnet beta'. These are exactly the kind of issues that one could expect in the early development stages of 'the world’s most performant global state machine', and ones that I am confident will be properly resolved long term.;0;2022-05-01 09:22:00;t3_ufkaky;/r/solana/comments/ufkaky/why_does_the_solana_network_go_down/i6vyso4/

ETH, Bitcoin, Cardano and a lot of other chains are a lot more decentralized (at a cost ofc) and in that case the only ""off"" time are hard forks";0;2022-05-01 00:06:26;t3_ufkaky;/r/solana/comments/ufkaky/why_does_the_solana_network_go_down/i6ul7na/
1970;wmredditor;"Here: 

The latest outage did not result in a permanent halt of the network as in the past. However, the severity of spam transactions means that only a few validators with high compute capacity are still online. Hence, a cluster restart is required to bring all validators back to speed and get the network in full flow.

1980;FunEarnings;Greedy bots! Hopefully Solana can implement that account-based throttling soon, I think it's a really creative idea to create those fee markets that only impact certain programs so that the network as a whole remains cheap while the programs getting spammed have fee increases (making it more expensive for bots).;0;2022-04-30 22:23:19;t3_ufl3uw;/r/solana/comments/ufl3uw/block_production_on_solana_mainnet_beta_has/i6u90b7/
