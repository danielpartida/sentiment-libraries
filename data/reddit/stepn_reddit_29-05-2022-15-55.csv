You bought in at around 14-15 SOL Floor price. SOL was trading around $52 at that time.

52 x 14.5 = $754 invested

GST was around $2.90-$3.05

You netted around = $300ish give or take in 2 weeks if you sold everything to USDC everyday(which i HIGHLY doubt since you're still hodling).

The SOL floor now is 8.2 SOL and SOL is trading at $42.

42 x 8 = If you sold your sneaker its value would be $336.

Now to take into account the fees of selling the sneaker of 6%

Would be around $316.

Meaning you are down -$438 USD currently just based on the Sneakers value.

Rug pulls are full of marketing campaigns, influencers, and promotions with huge follower growth that doesn’t make sense. Encouraging people to get in as fast as possible to create a spike of interest and incomes before pulling the plug out. 
So far, STEPN is regulating the entry and are slowly growing the community almost entirely organically. 

STEPN has a tremendous potential aligned with fitness, diets, fashion, entertainment, competitions, events (…) 

Constant AMA’s with both founders taking the time to explain carefully weekly milestones and updates. Real life events across the globe. 
Working with countries’ regulations to stay out of trouble. Developing new solutions and features each month. That requires huge amount of human ressources. 

They have updated their game plenty of time, experimenting. (beta phase, for those joining in during this phase should be aware of how it is managed. Many features are being tested live. If you don’t like surprises, better wait until final version). 

They are a 100% emotionally, mentally, and physically into setting the new standard of M2E apps.

67;superplexbeats;"Time will tell. StepN is in a period of aggressive growth and if realms are launched in quick succession, this creates more arbitrage opportunities to FOMO into. This will likely create more bagholders (those that invest at ATH prices). This may be the only strategy though to be honest - in order to beat the copycat competitors and grow the user base, the pain needs to be temporary and quick.

If the gameplay is identical between chains, then the GST token prices should align eventually. However, that's unlikely, since we already know that a new realm could be an entirely different genre of game and the equivalent GST token can be renamed.

Not sure what the future plan will be for energy sharing, but a concern I have is that there's a risk the original game no longer becomes relevant as people could constantly jump from chain to chain, seeking the best earnings. StepN would lose its brand identity.

The positives at the moment are that the team seems to be working flat out on development and communication is starting to become more timely and professional.

113;Familiar_Visit7488;"there were countless users from mainland china who were doing heavy mint-farming on BSC chain. since SOL chain has been there for a long time and floor prices on SOL are more or less stable, a new chain on BSC with low supply was best opportunity to make huge profit for those mint-farmers. they were minting in heavy numbers making huge profit. StepN team decided to roll out minting scrolls because of this, which will come up in the next update I guess. Also yesterday, StepN posted an update that they will ban the app for China because of their own government regulations. StepN was already not available in China (mainland) to download. but mint farmers were purchasing phones from Hong-Kong or other regions and then downloading the app from the Hong Kong App Store. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not saying that BSC minting was ""only"" done by Mainland China users, but yes it was ""mostly"" done by those users. Even though I think they are just banning the GPS, which will affect the runners, but not sure if it also affects the minters.

&amp;#x200B;

The floor prices dropped significantly ever since StepN announced the ban for Mainland users. If I am not wrong, the users from that region who were heavily invested in mint-farming are offloading their sneakers. 

&amp;#x200B;

If that is the case indeed then the prices should stabilize after July 15th (when the ban will come into affect).

114;Snwboardr9876;"Yeah I made a post on this about a month ago. It seems as if it is brought up semi-weekly…I guess that’s how often somebody actually reads TOS lol. 

I mean we have US ambassadors such as “Bitcoin Daily” who have already hosted a live meetup in Miami and the team is very aware of the usage in the US. 

However, after the China ban, I would say moral of the story is that anything is possible. I would say it’s basically a guarantee that this will be regulated in the US eventually if it gets big enough to get attention of regulators. At that point, since it’s technically in the TOS, Stepn would reserve the right to shut our accounts down since we violated TOS. 

Fortunately it does not appear as if that is their MO since they are giving China plenty of time to clear their assets off the platform before shutting down. 

Hope this helps give some clarity, clear as mud right lol.

132;Familiar_Visit7488;"GST-BSC was already overpriced. When SOL users were complaining that StepN is abandoning Solana users and making BSC users grow exponentially, the mods and StepN team tried to reassure all SOL users that the prices on BSC will cool down. They already told Solana users to not panic (now those users are quiet).

&amp;#x200B;

As for the anyone who invested in BSC, prices are more of what I would like to call ""stable"" at this point. $10 for GST-BSC is like $2 for GST-SOL. As long as it stabilizes around that point, I think it is a fair price. ROI is still 35-40 days at these prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course if anyone who tried to FOMO at the top of BSC must be feeling negative right now. But if you are in crypto, you should know that you do not want to chase pumps. It is more reasonable to invest when the prices at a stable point, as compared to when prices are rising exponentially and people put all their money at top because of FOMO. It happened to Solana users as well a few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you are talking about floor price, then this is exactly what the team was trying to point out. Gilgamesh pointed it out many times that BSC is an experimental chain right now. It had limited supply of sneakers and limited users. She advised SOL users not to be get misled and that the prices in BSC will cool down soon. And now it happened and people are still complaining.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Prices high --&gt; People unhappy

Prices low --&gt; People unhappy

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My focus is to secure the ROI and then enjoy the game. StepN is not the ticket to become rich but more a ticket to adopt a healthier lifestyle with an added incentive. 35-40 days ROI is still very lucrative from any investment point of view (even if it does not provide additional health benefits).

&amp;#x200B;

I think most of the people who get unhappy are those who get misled by Youtubers and social-media ""influencers"" about ""a magical app that can 10x your money in a few days"". They calculate lucrative ROIs at the pico-top when the project is at full-hype and lure new investors in who have never done their own research.

About Axie, I honestly have no idea. I never played the game, but as far as I know and correct me if I am wrong, Axie does not allow AXS token to be earned by playing the game. They have another token which you earn while playing the game. AXS is a governance token, but users do not have the option to earn it. Yes you can stake it and get the rewards, but minting it and earning by playing the game is not an option. It was not there and I am pretty sure even right now it is not the case.

Again I am not a StepN maxi, and obviously there are chances that the project will eventually lose value. In terms of probability, every crypto project has a chance to fail, nothing is 100% certain. 

But the app is still in Beta and it is still improving and bringing a lot of mew features and experimenting with different game mechanics to make the  game more sustainable.

Will they succeed? I hope they do, and as far as I can tell, until now, they seem to be on the right track. If they lose their track in the future and it becomes unsustainable, of course it will lose value.

But as you said, enjoy while it lasts. After securing the ROI, I think it is better to focus more on the health benefit side rather than focusing on “becoming rich with 20 minutes jogging” side.

138;Familiar_Visit7488;"Your have a valid point. But as your own words suggested “until the last GMT is unlocked”.

GMT has a fixed supply, unlike GST which is unlimited and its balance depends between minting vs burning. People were worried that this “unlimited” supply would result into a death spiral.

You understand the basics of crypto well, but that is not the case with normal users. If I talk about circulating supply, unlocks, vesting schedule etc, it would take a whole new article. 

Any crypto project with a fixed token supply is released based on a fixed vesting schedule. GMT unlocks will begin from next year, and right now the game is still in Beta which means a lot of new features will be introduced and a lot of issues will be addressed. Team has already said they are aware of the reasons why Axie failed and that is why they are trying to introduce their own gameplay.

There is literally no crypto project out there which is deflationary “right now” at the date. But the projects with fixed supply, like GMT, will become deflationary after the whole supply is released. As you said yourself, even Bitcoin is not deflationary “right now” but it will be after the max supply has been minted. I may not have a correct term to address this case, but my point was unlike GST which has an unlimited supply, which was the point of concern for many new users, GMT has a fixed supply and the gameplay is to reach level-30, unlock GMT earnings, and then users will have the option to switch between the earnings. If GST price to fall below GMT, users can switch to GMT and take away the selling pressure from GST and vice versa. Also more people opt to earn GMT at a certain time, the lesser GMT they will receive (just like in Bitcoin the miners reward get halved during every halving cycle).

The mechanism is complex, if someone wants to understand it, they can dive into the whitepaper and listen to the AMAs. But for new users who are not even familiar with blockchains and cryptocurrency, I wanted to make sure they get the distinction between the nature of GST and GMT.

And yes a part of GMT tokens were sold during private sale, but which crypto project has not done that? This is literally how the team raises initial funds to start a project. One cannot expect a team to build a project from their own garage with $0 funding. Of course a project needs initial funding. The point is whether the team is able to build a working viable product with that funding or just turn into a disappointment. Here the team is actually building a product that is helping people grow healthier. StepN is one of the few projects that actually had a working product during its launch. They did not launch a theoretical cryptocurrency with promises of a golden game and then just waiting to dump the private sales token on the users. But instead team actually came up with a product during the launch (remember we are still in Beta with a product that works really well) and they are still making a lot of improvements. 

Also the private sales token of GMT has a vesting schedule and the unlocks will begin from next year. Those tokens will not get unlocked on a single day where the team rug-pulls and runs away with all the money. The unlocks are periodic and at a fixed time frame.

The theoretical positive scenario is this; new users, more viable game mechanics to be introduced this year, more real world partnerships with other sports brand and other factors would be able to generate enough net positive revenue that it will compensate for the token unlocks and the withdraw sell pressure from users. Or else, if the users lose interest and the unlocks become overwhelming after a certain period of time when the selling pressure increase too much, of course like any other crypto project, StepN will also lose its value.

I am not a StepN maxi, and even if it goes to $0, i would still use the app after securing my ROI. Even if the financial benefit goes to 0, it is still giving me health benefits which is something not a lot of play to earn games can claim. But my point was that there is still a lot of time for that to happen, also it is one of “100% negative scenarios unfolding one after the other” case.

I have been in crypto and blockchain space for long enough time to say that I have 0 concerns with any private sales of tokens. Every project runs a private sale to secure initial fundings. As long as the team has a working product, it should be of no concern. All big projects like Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana had a portion of their tokens sold in private sales and went through unlocks. But like I said it happens at a fixed schedule. 

If you believe the token price is not sustainable and the project is losing its value, of course you can opt out and you will have enough time. Or you can be like one of those users who are only concerned about their ROI, and after that they use the app more for health benefits and less for financial incentives.";2022-05-28 08:29:10;t3_uz3vpa;/r/StepN/comments/uz3vpa/addressing_all_fuds_going_around_for_the_past_few/iaajjxc/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.659774124622345}];Neutral

140;Kaladin_the13th;"If you don't understand economics, maybe you shldn't proclaim your opinions as fact. BTC and ultimately GMT are deflationary simply bc they are capped. Their purchasing power is bound to increase (if not all people abandon the coin obviously). In Fiat you can print as much as you want, and many gvtms are doing that rn, but Bitcoin and GMT have fixed supply. And it gets harder and harder to mine BTC over time. So you have growing demand over time (it's just chart analysis, and compared to money locked in other assets BTC has a lot of headroom) AND stuff like losing BTC wallets is a thing.
I know economics is hard to understand, I myself am certainly not an expert, but why not do some research and read articles and papers about wether currency like BTC is inflationary or deflationary?

144;TheRealPaulTurner;"Thank you for the effort on this.  In addition to AMAs, this level of written explanation addressing new functionality, changes to mechanics and addressing concerns, no matter how obvious one might think the facts are, would go a long way to keeping the community positive.

The term FUD gets thrown around way too much in crypto and while there are genuine detractors to the project, I feel that a lot of people are new to crypto and further, don't understand tokenomics and market dynamics.   There is a fair bit of complexity in the STEPN system and even though I consider myself pretty seasoned in this space, I find the future hard to assess especially with a lot of cloak and dagger talk.  I deal with the uncertainty by just taking a portion of every day's earning out into stables.  I do this as a percentage every day without fail.  Having ridden projects to zero I think it is important that people understand that DCAing both in and out is important.   Nothing is guaranteed, always derisk as you go.

The STEPN AMAs and Barndog make an effort to explain things to this level of detail but often I find the founders are speaking from a position where they understand their vision and economics and assume that their audience should.  During the emergency AMA today they showed particular frustration with people not understanding.  As the saying goes, if the student doesn't understand, it is the teacher's failure, not the student's.

Having a limited supply doesn't mean much if you can't make it to the end. for ex : Jan 2027 will have 80% of tokens in circulation - as seen on the litepaper. Inflation is going to be huge, 8x increase in supply in less than 5 years.   
For this not to be an issue, new investors have to come in and burn, hold the token. Sounds familiar?  And ofc, no one will burn anything if there's no current/future financial gain.  


AXS had a limited supply as well and look what happened... They didn't even distribute anything from the play to earn AXS pile ( less selling pressure ) and ""burning"" was on point  
( \~70% AXS from minting went to treasury )  


I'm afraid this will share a similar fate so enjoy it while it lasts. And after it ends try and think of the positives : Stepn helped you build a healthy habit. Axie helped hundred of thousands of Filipinos during the pandemic.

160;summerfall-samurai;"Where do I even begin. 

For the context: I live in China,  have good friends living in Shanghai and every here and there around the Mainland. As well as I have been a part of a private crypto investment company in Guangzhou. 

Half of China isn't on lockdown. No idea where this comes from, but it's not true. Shanghai has been hit pretty hard and people there have been on a strict lockdown for the past two months at the very least. Outside Shanghai only a handful of low tier villages have been locked down and that didn't last for long. 

Taking a look at tier one cities and metropolitans like Beijing, Guangzhou and even Shenzhen (which had its own share of a lockdown not so long ago) - everything is fine. You get a neighborhood on a week-long lockdown and that's it. 

In regards to crypto being banned in China in general. Being banned doesn't mean it's not being used, traded, mined and whatnot. The CCP has been on the move to roll out bans after bans in the past years, yet at the same time they push eYuan. I am not saying it's the same thing, I am not, but what I am trying to say is that all those people that have been involved in crypto haven't gone anywhere.

Right now with Chinese ID cards and/or foreign passports if one is lucky to have being declined from being used for KYC - acquiring crypto in general is harder than ever, but is doable. Ever heard about P2P? That's a huge market over here with, for instance, localcryptos merchants and speculates trading ETH/BTC as low as 4% above the market (last time I may or may have not bought some).

While a bunch of markets and exchanges are inaccessible without VPN, Huobi is still yet accessible at this point and it is usable. Tricky, but usable, and it is one of the main tools for trading and/or investing in crypto for the local audience.

Chinese stock market is worse than crypto in terms of constant volatility. If anything there are a few trends to follow, but that is it. I personally met people who aren't internationally- or global-minded, true wumaos, who would approach me to ask about crypto. And those folks don't earn as much as foreigners in general (outside Mainland, if we compare countries' GDP and/or simply the lowest guaranteed wages).

161;summerfall-samurai;"Where do I even begin. 

For the context: I live in China,  have good friends living in Shanghai and every here and there around the Mainland. As well as I have been a part of a private crypto investment company in Guangzhou. 

Half of China isn't on lockdown. No idea where this comes from, but it's not true. Shanghai has been hit pretty hard and people there have been on a strict lockdown for the past two months at the very least. Outside Shanghai only a handful of low tier villages have been locked down and that didn't last for long. 

Taking a look at tier one cities and metropolitans like Beijing, Guangzhou and even Shenzhen (which had its own share of a lockdown not so long ago) - everything is fine. You get a neighborhood on a week-long lockdown and that's it.

If nobody buys Amazon Stock, it will have a price of Zero. So, for you to have a profit from buying low and selling high AMZN, you need someone else investing after you, and investing more per share.

In Stepn too there are already people who have lost money. Bc they invested and panic sold their stuff before ROI bc of uneducated FUD from people like you. So think about who's the culprit here.

172;Kaladin_the13th;"I don't see your point. The possibilities to burn and re-invest are totally optional, you can also choose to just buy a pair, walk and cash-in, it's your choice. Everyone has to decide on their own investing strategy, like with everything else, be it stepn, stocks or real estate.

Using hypotheticals leads nowhere. Your example wld mean Stepn just stops working, shutting down app. It's like saying ""what if Microsoft wld stop paying their staff? They wld leave and Microsoft stock wld crash"". I mean, like yeah xD
Nobody denies that we need demand for GST to have value. That's basic economics. Doesn't mean it's a Ponzi.

Just to have a common base of argument, here's the definition:
A Ponzi scheme (/ˈpɒnzi/, Italian: [ˈpontsi]) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. (Wikipedia) 

Does this happen in Stepn? Technically no, but kind-of yes Sometimes, if the new investors decide to buy GST (but even then nobody *lured* them to do so). I myself i.e. have bought a pair of shoes with Sol, never have bought a single GST. Now we don't know what the seller did with the Sol. Maybe he traded for GST to mint the next pair, maybe not. We know someone is buying GST directly, bc there is demand, and that's most likely people wanting a headstart and quicker leveling or outside investors trying to hop on the Stepn wagon. But both of those are not necessary to play the game, not even advertised for by devs and whitepaper. So I don't see how that part of the definition applies fully here.
And most important, how can this be a fraud if everything is transparent in the whitepaper and all those AMAs? Ponzi is a form of fraud, so without fraud, no ponzi. Simple. If the devs do sth shady and rugpull or sth, then yes, it was fraud. But they yet have to show such behavior.";2022-05-27 22:54:59;t3_uyukyi;/r/StepN/comments/uyukyi/the_ponzi_is_quickly_collapsing_i_tried_to_warn/ia90mmb/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5597587823867798}];Neutral

Ultimately when it reaches it's total minted supply, which by the way is being halved every 3 years, so that is long time away, The burning mechanism would have already reduced the total circulating supply by a lot, so all of this has major upside price pressure for gmt which would balance out the sell pressure.

203;reverent-girl;"Kekw you are being a bit delusional. There is currently not a single bit of actual monetary value backing up StepN. Walking is a cost, but it does not bring monetary value into the project. If like you said Nike does a promotional with StepN then it could have some real value. That value would be some proportion of the discount provided. The “Game” and “fitness” features of the app also bring no monetary value into the project. In both instances there are much better free games and fitness apps. 

The current price of shoes is essentially based on expected earnings. Expected earnings is dependent on current owners reinvesting and new customers buying in. In the white pages it is made quite clear that GST is inherently inflationary and the supply is only restricted by people burning them through upgrades and in app purchases. 

This should make it very clear that StepN will 100% collapse into oblivion at some point. Could be next week or it could be in 10 years. It all depends on public perception of the project, the external success of sol and crypto in general, and management decisions of the devs.

219;Aggressive-Taste-340;"Thank you for being so honest and respectful. 

I am not sure what the proportions are of new buyers and just people upgrading. I’m sure upgrades is more. In one of their articles STEPN acknowledged P2E has a Ponzi like nature, but to avoid this they implemented several key elements. One of them being to try and keep people playing, and not let them reach “the end game” easy. Because at the end game, people will cash out, which creates supply. 

Burning tokens by upgrading is a way of keeping demand up, and supply down. Which is probably why $GST performed really well earlier. But I’m afraid the lower it will go, the less interest people will have in STEPN. 

Idk, time will tell I guess. Main reason I posted this is because I saw with Terra how many people straight up started posting about suicide, it’s just sad to see people lose their everything.

You should be able to read the article, when it says subscribe click the X on the top right corner of the pop-up. 

I see where you’re coming from. And STEPN has made a very smart system. You get paid in $GST right? The dev’s know they won’t have a shortage of $GST anytime soon. Most Ponzi’s fail because they can’t pay anymore, but the only thing STEPN has to pay is $GST, and they will be able to do so for a very very long time. 

But who would want $GST? People only want it because it can be traded for dollars for a decent price. But ask yourself, where does the demand come from? Supply we know, it comes from walk earnings. 

The demand comes from new investors, and people re-investing.

My vague understanding of a ponzi scheme is that existing users only make money by getting more to join and same with new investors, they only make money when they invite more new investors. 

With stepn I can see how one might see it as a ponzi due to the initial cost to get started. However once you buy a shoe, you can start earning without inviting more people. Also as far as I know, there is no referral program incentivizing people to invite new players and get commission based on shoe sales. Please correct me if im wrong on that.

Also with the (eventual) release of a rental system the initial cost will likely be next to nothing to get started. You could say the app is unsustainable without constant flow of new customers, but that can be said about any industry. The arms industry isnt a ponzi scheme yet it requires people to kill and run out of ammo so they must buy more.

For STEPN, i think it is not fully ponzi, plus it can have lot of institutional investors that can make it sustainable more than classic play to earn project, because it gives some other benefits than making money. All of this is speculation that is on devs to implement and make it sustainable.

But after yesterday panic sell off a lot people sold in minus, then today it restored already a bit. Of course not gonna compare but when after 2018 bitcoin rally it dropped so much “everyone” not believed in it but after 3 years we saw unrealistic highs.. my friend from work resigned last year because he got enough of crypto to not work anymore, and he was still buying ( 2017-2021) when everything crashed.. not financial advice here.

StepN is too young to be already estabilized and had too hype, so there was a rush to go in and out, and this rise the price ""to the moon"" and after that to the hell.

I have crazy excel tables pulling web data from different sources for GST, GMT and SOL and refreshing ever 30 minutes to calculate what was/is happening and what I have to to do with leveling, spending, re-investing etc. So I already got my ROI back and I was luck enough to mint 2 uncommon sneakers using two common sneakers.

I am not complaining about my ROI but this drop made me feel the way I felt when I was burned with a scam. My lost was very small at that time and it was around 500-600 USD but it made me so mad that I could drown those so-called ""team members"" in a one bucket of water. This situation with GST/SOL made me re-visit my previous frustration and I felt for people loosing money because of scammers.

I mean we have mods in the discord saying something different from the devs saying something different from the Twitter, etc. 

Regardless of the news and it’s popularity/how it goes over in the community, messaging has to be clean and unified, and it just hasn’t been. Like it or not that significantly decreases confidence in the team &amp; project. And that’s no doubt a large contributing factor to the massive sell off, much more so than the China news (but that no doubt exacerbated the situation)

While I don’t necessarily agree with the energy sharing between Sol and BSC chains, for example, I can understand why they did it. But the team had wildly different messaging about how long it would last, etc. and that was a massive problem.

I'll address the new users first. When you invest into anything, you do your own research. Read the whitepaper, read about the founders. Then once you're in, you monitor what the team does. See how they behave, how open they are with their communication. How they handle difficult situations. The project lives or dies by the hands of their devs. A good dev team will navigate troubled waters, a bad/malicious dev team will rugpull the whole project come first chance.

This is a game. But this is also a serious project with a serious team behind it. They don't speak about things in weeks, but months and years. This project has been running strong for 6 months, and has a bright future ahead of it.

385;Blueline637;"People,

Please remember this is a crypto game, the whole market is in turmoil right now.

Yes maybe STEPN and GST and GMT are dropping more then the major cryptos but it’s understandable. Alot of smaller cap cryptos that utilize other blockchains will drop more then the blockchain themselves because people are selling the small caps buying the major coins.

My biggest recommendation is, play the game like you have been. Enjoy your walk or your run. Upgrade your shoes. Taking your earnings and convert to buy more shoes to get more energy so when the crypto market turns around you’re ready when the market explodes and you will be rewarded for holding.


I think a couple things the developers could do to help the game is start burning of shoes. I feel we def have more shoes then demand at the moment so burning a bunch can help stabilize the floor and bring it back up. Maybe allow the burning of shoes to take those base stats and portions of the upgrades to add to an existing shoe.

Again be patient don’t panic and add to your collection!";2022-05-26 19:37:30;t3_uyfgzx;/r/StepN/comments/uyfgzx/remember_this_is_a_crypto_game/ia3rw1u/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6354247331619263}];Neutral

437;Imworkingonit94;"Hi! 

Firstly, please ignore the person commenting above - they have no idea whether or not this project will collapse and seem to take some form of pleasure in shit posting.

That being said do be aware that this project is still
in Beta and numerous projects similar to this have failed in the past, I believe this has a far better chance than those but still you shouldn’t be investing anything that would badly affect you if you were to lose it.

I’d read the whitepaper on the Stepn site to really get a feel and see if this is a project that you believe in and can get behind long-term. This will help during the violent swings we are seeing in the entire Crypto space currently.

As for beginning a healthy lifestyle Stepn will certainly help! I never used to jog at all and now I find myself getting up everyday and looking forward to it, even when I was on holiday last week. 

If you are new to cardio in general I would recommend purchasing a Jogger, this will allow you to either fast walk or jog at a sensible speed every day. You can pick up a Level 5, 2/7 mint jogger for very cheap currently (12-14SOL). Use this to get started and get a good feel for the App, if you enjoy it then i’d recommend selling and upgrading to a Jogger with 0/7 mints, a few SOL more expensive but worth it if you plan to reinvest some profits back in to grow your collection in the future. 

Hope this helps!";2022-05-26 12:32:03;t3_uy5t59;/r/StepN/comments/uy5t59/getting_start_need_some_advices/ia22wy1/;1;[{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.6081697940826416}];Negative

473;scenia;"Don't forget that high earners leaving the chain also reduces GST supply on SOL substantially. And if we reach the point where many new people actually join BSC outright rather than switching from SOL, this drives demand on SOL pretty massively since they then need 8+ SOL shoes.

Either way, ""overused"" would imply the majority of users being on BSC and that's not gonna happen as long as the buy-in is that high. Don't forget starting on SOL requires just one sneaker at around $700, while starting on BSC using the loophole requires 1 BSC and 8+ SOL sneakers at a total of around $12000. That's a factor of 17 and additional risk of price drops since it's propped up. Many people interested in stepn can (or want to) afford an initial investment of $700, but not $12000.

If at some point BSC becomes the next level after SOL and users switch once they reach a certain point, this will cut GST supply more than demand, so it is in fact beneficial for the SOL chain. If we're talking sustainability, we should also take into account the fact that GMT earning will be much more profitable on SOL once it's unlocked, and since it requires a level 30 sneaker, this means a lot of demand for SOL-GST.";2022-05-26 06:54:08;t3_uxkqij;/r/StepN/comments/uxkqij/maybe_im_missing_something_but_how_is_the_energy/ia1cr4h/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6409652233123779}];Neutral

486;Orihisoy;"Stepn has two chains - bnb and sol. 

The two chains are separate entities - the coins (GST in particular) and nft in one cannot cross over to the other.

Stepn team wants to encourage adoption of bnb chain, but price to enter is too high. So, they make energy sharing a feature - that is, the energy you have is dependent on the total number of bnb and sol sneakers you own.

Due to (1) low users on bnb generating GST and (2) high demand for GST to level and/or mint sneakers, GST in bnb shot up in price.

A bunch of sol users realised that they stand to earn A LOT by buying one bnb sneaker and walking/running on bnb. Migration of users from sol to bnb happened.

Some sol users are not happy with that. They want (1) to earn the same amount as bnb users without buying a bnb shoe and/or (2) want the bnb users ""punished"" for exploiting this ""loophole"".

In the video he also says this will happen when the Realm system is more at scale, which he mentions may be in a couple months.

494;tbomit;Really??? I would have thought it would be more then 7+% but I don't have anything to back that up but regardless let's just take that 1% of current users... the idea is that if all the money goes in through the Sol chain and out the binance chain is not healthy for stepN.  Sol gst will be even harder to cash out.  Binance gst will still be in demand because that 1% will need it to level and mint more shoes to try and sell at some inflated price. Then if others see that stepN rewards that type of a system others will join, growing that 1% to some higher percentage. Furthermore, if sol people have an increasingly hard time cashing out their gst they will either leave the app(further damaging the demand part of the supply/demand curve) or also want to buy a Binance shoe and game the system that way. Both outcomes would raise the 1% to a much higher percentage. How is that sustainable ?

Some summary points and quick tldr:

1. Binance chain is new and Stepn team is trying to grow it 

2. They’re trying to grow it by promoting this energy sharing system, which gives a lot more gst to the new Binance users 

3. It’s unclear if they know or could anticipate the damage this would cause to the Solana community 

4. They have stated that in about 4 weeks or so, they will separate the energy systems of the two chains 

5. All of stepn’s assets and liquidity, as they have publicly stated, is on Solana. Effectively, “if the Solana chain dies, Stepn dies” and they’ve stated this quote verbatim on discord. So they won’t let Stepn die. 

6. What’s happening now is just a lot of new investor panicking. We’ve had bad moments before, people here will remember the $10 GST crisis recently that almost caused a Stepn death spiral. The project is in good hands.

517;chrisv650;"People worrying about SOL/BSC are thinking short term... the one important thing for STEPN to get right is long term burning of GST.

As long as they can get this nailed, STEPN is viable. If not, constant supply inflation and inevitable kaboom.

Although supply/demand has an influence on sneaker price the main thing underpinning it is earning potential which relies on long term price stability of GST. If GST tanks, sneaker price will follow then all our ROI calcs are out the window.

My suggestion would be to give users people the option to participate in the app without a sneaker purchase for a monthly fee in GST paid up front. If they complete their goal for energy they get a lottery ticket for a mystery box or something. That way you have a constant fiat demand for GST and burning mechanism, so we know where the money that sneaker owners is coming from other than ""constant user growth"".

540;Standing_Objection;"You're missing two main things in your calculation. 

1. Sol's price of $100 has halved since you bought. At $50, your initial investment should really be calculated based on today's value, since if you just held your SOL, you'd only have $2300 worth today.  StepN can't do anything about loss in value of SOL. 
2. Leveling up is not included in most people's ROI calculations.  For example, if you bought a level 19 shoe for a little more $ instead of leveling up, you'd have saved more GST. Leveling up to 19 from 0 costs 215 GST ($300-600) and 40 GMT ($50-80). 

So really, your initial investment was more like $2,600 and you've earned closer to $2,000.  Also, like others have pointed out, your level 19 shoe is now worth a minimum of 23 SOL, up 8 SOL.  If you sold everything now, you'd have a minimum of 49 SOL, plus $1500 in your pocket. Not bad for a months work.

573;hearsdemons;"It’s not all that bad if you’re just starting out. The drama is more around those who started out before the Binance chain was released a few weeks ago. 

In the beginning, there was just the Sol chain. So you bought shoes, invested and played solely through the solana chain.  Everyone was on an even playing field. 

Then the Binance chain was introduced. And with this new chain, the prices were much different than the solana chain. So whereas shoes were $650 floor price and gst was $3 on solana, on the Binance chain the shoes were and are still going for a minimum price of $5k and a new Binance gst token was introduced that is now reaching $30. This alone is not an issue. Different chains can have different eco systems and different prices. You pay more to get into the game on the Binance chain, so obviously you get more in return for it as you run daily. Makes sense. 

The problem becomes when the loophole is introduced. This loophole allows for energy sharing between the two chains. This means someone on the Binance chain just has to buy 1 expensive Binance shoe ($5k) and 8 super cheap solano shoes ($5k). With this total of $10k investment, they could then run on the Binance chain and make thousands per day. 

The same person on the solana chain would make something like $200 or so for the same 9 shoe set up, if all shoes were on solana. 

This creates a disadvantage. If things were kept separate on the chains, well that makes sense. Low entry/low rewards on one chain, high entry/high rewards on the other chain. It’s when you take advantage of the solana chain by amassing shoes on it, solely so you can benefit more on the Binance chain that people start feeling like the Stepn dev team is favoring one chain over the other, and not incentivizing the game enough for the solana chain.";2022-05-25 15:17:08;t3_uxf0z7;/r/StepN/comments/uxf0z7/plan_to_correct_solbinance_energy_sharing_issue/i9y0iha/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7484954595565796}];Neutral

604;hearsdemons;"Most of you are probably aware by now the current drama surrounding the Binance chain, and it’s energy sharing issue with the Sol chain. Whether it’s a loophole or it was intended for this to work in this manner, he has led to people stacking up on super cheap shoes on Sol (think 8 Sol shoes for the price of 1 Binance shoe) and then earning in Binance GST amounts, which is 10x the price of the Sol GST. This has opened up such a large disadvantage that it has made playing in the Sol chain basically useless. 

So what’s the solution? The solution is to even out the playing field. First of all, in all likelihood, things will probably stay the same as they are now. Why? Because energy sharing between chains is an integral part of the Stepn game, as Yawn has explained plenty of times in his interviews. That’s here to stay. Yawn’s vision for the game is to set up different “realms”, which are different servers and have early players migrate to new realms, presumably to reinvest into the game and take some pressure off of having all of the income stream coming from new users. So, energy sharing is here to stay. The loophole will probably not be closed because using your assets from one realm to play in another realm is how the energy sharing system currently works. 

So what’s the solution here? Have Sol players have a bite at the apple. They should need to buy $5k sneakers like they’re just starting the game all over again. Give them a chance to get a Binance sneaker, perhaps through minting? Small chance, whatever it may be, will raise the morale of the community. Make 3% or even 1% to mint a Binance shoe on the Binance chain from minting two solana shoes. Or if that’s not possible for whatever reason, figure something out. If there’s a will, there’s a way. And this is a solution I see that would satisfy the community, level the playing field and keep the current loophole in place since that won’t be closed anyway.

624;zdorsett;"Sol gst doesn’t go up because many people are making massive incomes in gst every day and many of them are taking that income out of the game in the form of cash as opposed to using it to level their sneakers etc. When the gst is burned for game features it causes supply to decrease and price to increase. If gst is being generated by the game through engagement and then is cashed out it causes supply to grow and price to go down. Because of a much more established playerbase in sol, this is happening now as opposed to with BSC where this will likely happen in a few months.

628;ragnarkar;"Here's something I've been thinking about for a while but didn't have the right words for.

I used to work for a hedge fund manager a decade ago. If an investment with an ROI of 30-100 days really existed, what will we do? We're gonna invest millions into it and get rich quick! (Of course there are risks but we'd certainly pour a ton of money that we can afford to lose into such an investment.)

Now, you can't simply pour millions into StepnN and expect to make it all back in a few months. You have to put all of that money into shoes, upgrade them, and walk a ton everyday. You can easily buy 30 shoes with 1 million dollars to get the max energy but you still need to walk to earn the money. Maybe if you had unlimited money, you'd buy 30 legendary shoes and get an insane energy bar but there's still a cap to how much money, say, a L30 legendary shoe can earn in 1 day even if they had enough energy for 24 hours of walking.

Imagine for a second that you didn't need to walk and the earnings come automatically. A hedge fund with millions will create a crapload of accounts, fill them up with 30 shoes, and sit there making passive income. But by doing that, the prices of shoes will skyrocket and the little guy like you and me will not be able to afford them. Also, when the price of shoes rises, it effectively increases the ROI period and it'll take much longer to make back your initial investment. And one of the attractive features of Stepn, at least now, is the relatively fast ROI but if that's gone, nobody will join.

I'm not sure if I'm the only one who sees it this way but the walking requirement makes it very difficult for people with deep pockets from ruining the earnings from this project or investment or whatever you call it since there's only 24 hours in a day whether you are broke or a miltimilionaire and you're required to spend them walking to earn from this project.";2022-05-25 04:52:41;t3_uwnila;/r/StepN/comments/uwnila/lots_of_hate_on_rcryptocurrency_lately_what_do/i9we1uo/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6199920773506165}];Neutral

636;Frequent_Push_4670;"I did not look at level 19 shoes lately, when I looked last time it was much lower floor price before this exploded so I assumed it didnt changed much. But yes you re right buying level 19 wouldnt be profitable as level 9.

But what I am trying to say is that early users of stepn they already reach their ROI on sol and this is just new roi just for bsc. So for early users it is very profitable to go to bsc chain. 

For new users it is actually very risky as you are saying.

That is why I dont like that early users luring new users in bsc because they are not telling them that they are actually profiting that much because they are early users and already reached or passed they ROI on sol, and it is not that much risk for them to go to BSC. And lot of newcomers dont look that for them is much more riskier, they just see daily earnings om BSC which is huge, and they try to get in without questions.";2022-05-25 04:06:40;t3_uwxh4q;/r/StepN/comments/uwxh4q/eta_is_4_weeks_to_correct_the_current_solbinance/i9w9g08/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5017513036727905}];Neutral

639;Shturec91;"Ok , firstly a bit about my story (longer than intended) :  
  I am mid-class 9 to 5 grind ant at the age of 31 and single, meaning ivestment is possible for me even at the rate of 1 Netflix subscribtion (\~30$) splitted in two every 15 days. I don't understand jack shit of the real Stock Market and all its terminology and complexity, but I've heard alot about the possibility of getting rich or homeless in less than 24 hours. And because I doubt that I will have the time or nerve to actually get good enough to make calculated risks there I got interested in crypto investing the moment I heard stories from friends, most of which were at the bull side of the market (5 of 7 friends), doubling their ROI few months after they've started diving in the Blockchain and the opportunity to get familiar with this system that is intensively developing and being a copy of the real market made me think about the possibilities myself.

   Three months later I've already felt like I gathered enough knowledge to invest money and that time was 2 days after the launch  of  STEPn ( as GMT in Binance).    
   Closest to me is a 5 years seasoned  ETH, Doge,BSC investor and miner that have the long-term idea of eventually transfrering his wealth in an environment that will grand him security with grains of hope for snowballing his investment in a bull run.  
When I asked him about his advice after the DIP of GMT to 1.40$ at the time of writing which I bought at 3.5$ and is 70% of my portfolio, he told me the same as you - STOP INVESTING in that project even if it  is an infant. And I did.   
  So my question is - NOW WHAT ? Do I sell and savor what's left of my folio or risk losing it all ? -  Walking , keeping good health, doing some extra dime while doing it, sound good, right ?. It is a new project and it's bad moment for it to emerge.

I can't afford a sneaker - did I saved myself some sleepless nights ?

Then the Binance chain was opened up. And there’s a new Binance GST token. Now that token is skyrocketing. It hit $40, came back down and now in the $20s going back up. The dev team have not intervened at all. And so those in the Binance chain are allowed to profit. The cheapest shoes in Binance chain start at $5,000 so it’s not easy to get into it now. Those that are in it are making bank.

To answer your question: 
- for someone who can’t afford a shoe, they are releasing free leasing in quarter 4, so that those who cannot buy a shoe of their own can earn for free, with a portion going to the person who owns the shoe.

- unfortunately, things seem worse than they are right now. The fundamentals of STEPN are still in place. Nothing has changed. But Bitcoin and crypto as a hole are in a bear market right now. Things are in a downtrend and STEPN is not immune to that entirely. I don’t think STEPN is going anywhere though, regardless of bear market.

-this team has a lot planned and it’s up to them to continue being creative and crafty in creating money sinks and maintained interest in the project which I do not doubt they will pull off. With marathons, leasing, new game mechanics and more coming soon, I believe they can do it.

GST comes from inflation. It has an infinite supply. Infinite supply - token goes to 0 overtime. This can only be viable if more people chooses to reinvest in a game than dumping their tokens into a market. 

The value of such projects comes from engagement, community, brand, etc. The tokens are just incentives for holding NFTs, NFTs only have value because of these incentives or because people actually like the game. 

Same may see this as a game, some see this as a financial scheme (ponzi) wrapped into a game. 

I do believe there is some value here. It can go viral since it's easy to market it through word-of-mouth.

778;Wonderful-Court926;"Being sustainable and being a Ponzi scheme are different. People keep asking is it a Ponzi but it is not. According to Investopedia:

Most Ponzi Scheme's Ponzi share similar characteristics:  
1. A guaranteed promise of high returns with little risk (Stepn makes no promises)

2. A consistent flow of returns regardless of market conditions (returns are based on market)

3. Investments that have not been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (Stepn is not investing for us)

4. Investment strategies that are secret or described as too complex to explain (Everything is clear in Whitepaper... seems to be no secrets and besides they are not investing for us)

5. Clients not allowed to view official paperwork for their investment (Its open blockchain)

6. Clients facing difficulties removing their money (easy to get cash out money)

The developers are trying very hard to make this app adopted by the masses like the stock market and thus mostly sustainable. So that is the question: Is is sustainable? Time will only tell.

As you may already be aware, Solana sometimes has network congestions that result in transactions taking hours to complete.  
  
For now, please give any transaction 24 hours to self-solve. This includes wallet-to-spending, spending-to-wallet, and wallet-to-wallet transfers.

To answer your question about whether now is a good time to buy Sneakers …

If you are looking to get started on Solana … with the recent crypto downturn, SOL is about 50% less than it was last month. The floor prices, in SOL, have remained fairly consistent. This means if you are converting fiat to SOL … you can get your Sneakers for ~50% less than someone a month ago.

I just realized that you don't need to get 100% of your investment back for it to be profitable. My shoes cost 18 sol, and lets say the game only exists for another 4 months: 

EVEN IF I spent some of my GST on leveling up and buying more shoes, and only got back *half* of my initial investment, there is still a health benefit, and I say this as a fat lazy guy that just lays on the sofa all day, 

Stepn has made me go out EVERY SINGLE DAY, most days twice to walk/jog, in +35°C. I think that the health benefit /lifestyle change that 4 months of daily exercising does is worth 9 SOL on its own, probably more! 

If stepn stopped working today, I would still be 98% more likely to keep walking 10 minutes every day than I was before. And if Stepn was still around, but had a 90% drop in GST rewards, I could still walk myself into getting a free weekly beer. 😁

I'm the (almost) the furthest from a health nut you can get (I don't smoke or do drugs, *yet*) but I can actually see myself doing daily exercises now, even *without* stepn. And this after only two weeks. What about after 2 months?? 

Hell, if I could deposit $1000 with a smart contract in Stepn and *earn them back* (perhaps even with some interest?) I would do it, to FORCE myself to do the work, every day!

TL;DR: Even if you were to lose money on stepn, your health benefits might just make up the difference, even if you don't see it that way.";2022-05-20 17:54:32;t3_uu0ae9;/r/StepN/comments/uu0ae9/stepn_x_mental_health_what_do_you_think/i9cv33w/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5067965984344482}];Neutral
966;PlainVenom;I would also like to note, that gst in theory should keep going down as long as more is released to the market. Some people then call it a ponzi scheme because new users are forced to buy a shoe. But shoe purchase is in sol or bnb. So these two have a utility and Stepn users will buy them increasing the value of those coins. But this doesn't influence gst positively, in fact it just results in more gst being released onto the market. Which will devaluate GST. So these points that the show can only last while new users are coming only counts for minting strategies not for walking strategies. So what reason do people have to buy gst and keep our lovely returns up or make them higher in the long term, what utilities could there be to buying GST?;2022-05-20 17:52:25;t3_uu23ja;/r/StepN/comments/uu23ja/discussion_post_stepn_longevity/i9cut0y/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6391485929489136}];Neutral

978;exivor01;"In this scenario, 1 minter can only hold off the selling pressure of 18 common walkers (10 GST per day each, if everyone holds 1 common walker separately.) now, not everyone is walking with only 1 common shoe, many are going for at least 3 shoes for 4 energy and others are going for 9 sneakers etc. We have no way of knowing how many minters there are, but as long as we have enough, we should be burning more GST than daily generated GST's. And not everyone who earns is selling directly.   


But it's not like this, I have the proof. go check dextools and you can see for yourself as well. Every day, the total circulating GST number is rising. That means there's just not enough burs happening, not enough minters. And this is how it is supposed to happen. You can never have more minters because thousands of people will just want to run and sell gst for a quick profit. And as we reach higher users, the majority of them will be walkers who just sell GST. Not minters. Because to become a minter, you need to make calculations and a plan. not everyone can do that, or think about that. So I don't like the idea of stepn having millions of users. We can never sustain such sell pressure. And those millions of people will arrive because of daily 30$ earnings. When that is no longer sustainable, they will dump the market. So it's NEVER a good idea to reach that many users IMO.   


That's why I'm keeping my risk very very low on stepn. Not investing too much into it. ""I already ROI'd anyways"" Stepn is like a bomb waiting to explode, again this is just my opinion. Also, don't even think about GMT holding after GST dumps below 1 dollar. At that point, there will be no hype or trust left for the project. And switching from GST to GMT in the long run isn't feasible as well, because majority of the players ar efixing their shoes and buying their shoes by considering the GST earnings. What will happen to all of those shoes? Even if stat reset comes, GMT is coming from comfort level, we've all been trying to buy high EFF and RES stat shoes. all of those shoe's prices will dump.";2022-05-20 14:44:16;t3_ut6sgn;/r/StepN/comments/ut6sgn/can_someone_answer_this_please/i9c2hua/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.759047269821167}];Neutral

996;scenia;"I think it will happen around the time renting is released. At that point, there's little reason for new users to buy in since they can just rent, so demand for sneakers will drop to the point where only those who are willing to pay for the shortcut buy sneakers when they start playing. In other words, once renting is here, only your typical whales will buy sneakers to start, so that's when the equilibrium should happen. It could come a little earlier due to anticipation or a little later due to market inertia, but I'd expect it to be somewhere within +/-1 month of renting release.

It should be noted that when that happens, even at $0.1/GST, we're still looking at ~$1 for a 10 minute daily walk on a decent lv9 walker. At that point, ROI will become less important and people will reinvest their earnings, building up their collection in order to reach high energy and high quality shoes, that's honestly the point where this becomes really interesting as a game. And that's why I think a low GST price is a blessing in disguise.

By the way, even someone who bought in at $1000/shoe would break even in 3 years once we're at 0.1, which is a 33% return.

1035;scenia;It basically depends on how much money is coming in through outside investors. At the end of the day, there's nothing that inherently generates money in stepn, so the money anyone cashes out is the same money someone else puts in. This can go the same way it went with Bitcoin, with prices going up over time for a long time, but the question is why would anyone use GST over other cryptos. As long as it has utility in the app, there's an incentive to buy GST and burn it, but once prices do drop, the benefit of that decreases and people will be less willing to pay for it, putting more downward pressure on the price. This is why people expect GST to go down to the cents range, where it will probably stabilize because the app does offer non-financial benefits that are worth money to some people.;2022-05-19 21:33:29;t3_utdd4t;/r/StepN/comments/utdd4t/new_user_growth_will_slow_down_thats_innevitable/i993e4s/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7320250272750854}];Neutral

It’s quite ingenious. Kind of like mixing a no-production and maintenance cost Gym-membership (New Years resolution: book for 2 years and only go for a month), a casino (Roulette, BlackJack) with a sports-based game (reward through endorphins release + monetary (seemingly) rewards). All this makes StepN highly addictive and lucrative. You think you can game the system because you can calculate a profit for yourself but your time spent with the app and you feeding tokens and money back into the system is the actual product. Even Facebook and YouTube weren’t always profit-producing. In the starting phase there usually are investors and a push to get as many people onto the platform as possible. That’s the phase we are in at the moment. Eventually, the real monetisation comes where either user-data is sold, adds are brought in and sold, the rewards are lowered and there is so much more governance and complexity, that it gets really difficult to calculate if you are actually making profit or just staying hooked into the system while paying for it (and not even noticing).";2022-05-19 15:56:38;t3_ut36a8;/r/StepN/comments/ut36a8/how_does_stepn_make_money_just_running_and/i97rzv7/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5798000693321228}];Neutral

I had a runner for a month, and it was not worth at all for me. I sold it. Running every day even for a 10 minutes is just overwhelming. Also consider you need to buy real shoes that are good, because if you run in like some cheap ass shoes your legs will start to hurt, joints will also suffer, could get injured and so on especially if you never run before.

I am not some lazy dude that doesnt run at all, before stepn I run like 2,3 times a week for 30min-60minutes, and it was still overwhelming for me to run every day.

It is true that runners earn you most but it is such a small difference that is not worth. Also you can see on market that all the cheapest shoes are runners, there is a reason for that. 

Imo, stepn shoud very much consider boosting rewards for runners shoes or remove them fully.

But again if you are some kind of high profile athlete than runners could be good for you.

1147;superplexbeats;"In traditional video games, developers nerf certain strategies if they are being exploited too much. The same type of attention is needed for StepN to ensure longevity. The actions in the game need to result in a balance between earning and burning GST / GMT. Later this year, lots of people are going to be leasing shoes - I just hope that being a lessor doesn't become the main meta, otherwise players with a low starting capital are going to be priced out of shoe ownership.

We need the token values to be pretty range bound. If the price rises too much, traders outside of the game will go heavy on shorts. If the price crashes, this will leave a sour taste for players that bought in too high.

I'm interested in what the 'badges' will be used for. In addition to levelling up shoes, maybe you could have a system where you could level up yourself! For example, if your average one mile time improves, maybe they could give you a little boost. If StepN partner up with official race events, maybe they could validate your entry and time, and then reward you based on performance.";2022-05-18 18:08:40;t3_usah9u;/r/StepN/comments/usah9u/real_question_as_an_active_user_do_you_think_this/i93ov6q/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5901861786842346}];Neutral

1152;Vast_Stretch817;"No I don't think GMT can reach that low. It has deflationary properties. Meaning there will never be more tokens in circulation than their initial supply, only less. So if everything goes right and the project develops well then at least it can maintain the current price but if there is demand then it will go up. 
Also take under consideration the liquidity pair which can also have an impact on the price as well as the overall market condition as well.


GST on the other hand has inflationary properties. It has unlimited supply and more GST is minted as you use the STEPN app. It is very hard to guess what will happen but lets use some logic. If there much more daily users of STEPN than now then there will be much more GST minted and put in circulation. Automatically that means the price will go down.

1173;Imworkingonit94;"Do you mean $1-1.5 per GST? If so then yeah I think you are probably in the right ball park, i’m a little more bullish and think we have at least the rest of the year at $2.5+ (depending on the state of crypto in general).

The team have mentioned a lot that their #1 priority for Stepn is longevity. To do that they are most likely aware that there must be some level of decent earnings (although decent earnings just depends on where you are in the world).

I think there is massive potential for extra GST sinks as the game increases popular; have mentioned before on here I could see it overtaking apps such as Strava etc. 

With that large a user base tracking and sharing runs etc they could really bring cosmetics into play, that would be a huge token sink and also helps defeat the current Ponzi arguments that the only reason GST/GMT is currently burnt is to create more than the original amount burnt in the future.

The marathon mode, weekly competitions etc also interests me. Will they charge a fee to enter? Could they then burn half the total pot and distribute the rest between the winners? Again that would be huge way to burn on a regular basis and decrease supply.

There are so so many possibilities, this is the best M2E app on the market and the team really seem to care/know what they are talking about; obviously with projects like this unexpected things can happen to ruin it but l think we are in good hands.

1190;HomeworkCold3416;"Well I think crypto community is doing a lot of soul searching after Luna's collapse. We are looking at projects with more critical eyes, which is actually good.

Under the current model Stepn is a Ponzi. Reading this reddit, it's obvious most realize it. Those who don't are usually made too euphoric by all the free $ they're receiving and have dreams of that continuing indefinitely.

So under the current model, the only two questions are, how long can it last and how low can the price of gst go? The answer to second question is easy. If there is no influx of new money, the price of gst will be where the price of slp is now.

How long can it last? If you go to any busy area, there are people walking all around you and they could all be running Stepn app in their pocket. The pool of potential users is vast, way bigger than Axie. Stepn could turn into a worldwide phenomenon, or it could never really take off outside the crypto community. 

In the first case, existing users could get multiple x on their initial investment into next year and beyond. In the second case, things could slow down to a crawl already in the next few months and those of us who were buying at the local top (at sol $100) can't hope for much more than getting our investment back, if even.

Now for my “not financial advice” segment.  Do I think the returns will stay this high or higher?  No.  You have to remember they are in a public beta.  I expect when they shed the beta tag and for full public, we’ll see it drop.  I’m guessing probably somewhere between $1-$2 per gst.  I’m not sure gmt, as the use cases are just coming out on gmt.

1291;mimiguy06;"&gt; I did a test with GMT via Solana network at Binance yesterday and my 2 GMT have not yet arrived on my Stepn wallet. Because of my question, can I use BNB network via Binance to send my GMT?

It's normal, the Solana network is congestioned. The transaction can take 24h or be rejected (and you're refound).

If you send your GMT on BSC (Binance), you will can only buy with BNB. You can't send from Binance Smart Chain to Solana because Solana aren't compatible. The best things, if you wan buy solana sneakers is to try with FTX or other exchange. Because Binance is full since 1 week. Or wait more time and to be patient !

The Stepn team will work on a multi-chain wallet (for make transfert between BSC &amp; SOL), but we need wait a litle bit for having this fabulous functionnality (see the roadmap) : https://stepn.com";2022-05-17 14:19:28;t3_urgym8;/r/StepN/comments/urgym8/can_i_use_bnb_network/i8y61m5/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7416020035743713}];Neutral

1359;JamesIsBest87;The StepN whitepaper goes over all the  basics quite well.  Most questions can be answered with it.  If you have the money and are willing to buy 3 shoes you will start off with 4 energy instead of 2, more upfront cost for bigger long-term gains.  Only 1 shoe needs to be strong, the rest can be just there for energy.  When buying keep the number of mints in mind, if you plan on minting it is better to buy 0-1 mint shoes than those with 2+ mints.  As far as your main shoe, walker is great if you want to just take a leisurely stroll, it has the lowest ROI though.  Runner has the highest ROI of the 3 (trainer can get more but are quite a bit more expensive), but you need to keep up 8+ kmph pace which is difficult for most people.  Joggers are a happy medium that give mid ROI and can be done with a fast walk or slow jog, they are the most expensive outside of trainers as they are highly desirable.;2022-05-17 02:10:14;t3_ur6mrh;/r/StepN/comments/ur6mrh/im_way_to_slow_on_the_discord/i8wcha7/;1;[{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7184730768203735}];Positive

1362;chronosim;"Step 1.
Get a code.

Step 2. 
Get a shoe, a runner.

Step 3.
Start running, while also upgrading the shoe after every run. 

Step 4.
Upgrade it to level 19, because I’m confident it’ll have some long term success but going straight to lv.30 is too bullish.

Step 5.
Run every day at a park near home, where are no traffic lights and plenty of other people running/jogging.

Step 6.
Lose some motivation when GST goes down by 50% because some president sneezed and it’s bitcoins fault, but still running almost every day. 

Step 7. 
Get frustrated for not running everyday when the GST goes +145% overnight because user adoption is increasing and rent feature is about to be released. Promise to never miss a day again.

Step 8.
Get injured from running too much. Not real injury, but some pain here and there and it feels like I should rest a bit.

Step 9.
On a rainy morning, while running with pain in my legs and frustrated for dipping often below the 8km/h earning threshold, I get surpassed by another runner. This runner stays alongside, keeping my pace, and asks me “are you ok?”. 
I turn to answer, “Yeah, I’m fine, it’s just… rain. But who likes it, right?” - then I see her, a long lock of wet hair coming out of the side of her hood and a smile. “I’m actually enjoying it” - she answers - “the smell, the sound of rain, the cold raindrops on my face. It always feels new, fresh, shiny.” - and she keeps smiling. We chat and I really enjoy the run. My 2 energies are up, but I don’t mind. After learning that she’s new in the town, learning about her hobbies and about the fact that her new boss is a bitch, it’s been more than double my usual runs and I can’t take a step more. We say goodbye, but agree to meet again on a run, I’ll be running also tomorrow, and the next day, and so on…

Step 10.
Next morning is still gray, but the weather is fine. Will I meet her? Who knows. I “casually” try my best to be as close to arrive at yesterday’s hour, and to my surprise, she’s already there. We run, we chat, it’s fun. 

Step 11.
We run everyday together. Of course after some time I mention STEPN, I could give her an activation code after all! I don’t want to sound like a weirdo excited about a Ponzi scheme inviting her to buy a 13 Sol NFT shoe, so I’m choosing my words carefully. She laughs, but not for the reason I imagined - instead, I discover she’s already a Stepn user and runs with an uncommon. 

Step 12.
Things evolve. I invite her out and we start dating. The feelings grow fast, very fast - we’re runners after all. Then it just happens: we mint a shoe together. We’re both very happy with our mint, we know that it’ll level up to become a great shoe. 

Step 13.
We mint more and both get to 3 shoes. 

Step 14. 
I sell a shoe and upgrade to an uncommon, a jogger, because I can’t sustain running everyday with 5 energy.

Step 15.
We have different paces, and stuff starts to crumble. We’re not running together anymore, I’m way too slow. She can’t stand her job and she misses her hometown. She also made new friends and I’m busy too, so suddenly it seems that we’re not spending any time together. 

Step 16.
We don’t date anymore. I start flipping shoes and don’t even bother going to run everyday anymore. 

Step 17.
I see her at the park, again. It’s evening, I changed my running routine in order to not run into her, and apparently she’ve done the same. … why did we break up again? It’s too stupid, any reason right now didn’t seem good. I continue running at my pace, she’s further away. … What the hell?! I don’t care about gst. I start running, FAST. No Gst earned, but I reach her. 
“Simona!” - “hey, it’s you, how are you?” - that’s when I realize I don’t have nothing to say. We’re not compatible as we’ll never run shoulder to shoulder. My eyes go down, then I see it. It’s a notification, from CoinMarketCap - “GST -99% in the last hour”, it says. I look at her and I shout: “We’re free! We no longer have to run, our shoe difference now means nothing!”.
Little did I know that every crypto and stock collapsed in a never seen before black swan event.

Step 18.
We marry, mint a couple of kids, sell them on the black market for ~128 sol each.

1385;MEPHiSTO6666;Do a run/walk where you use all of your 5 energy in one go or better start when you have the full 5 energy and 15 mins before the next refill so you use up 1.25 energy before it refills (aka ‘125% strategy’ - Google that with STEPN for more details on that). That way you use 6.25 energy in one run. How much energy you use (in one go) has about as much impact on whether or not a MB drops as luck (or possibly more) I use 10 energy with just 11.8 luck and get a mystery box pretty much every time I do that, occasionally with energy usage as low as 5.

Should we both start with a shoes? And level up.. transfer the shoes to 1 account to mint 2 times, after which we both can have 2 shoes each and then finally mint 2 more to reach 3 shoes each?? If soo should we both start with a Level 0 or level 5? 

Also mints? What should we aim for?

Of course makes ton of sense from the StepN point of view, the reason they propose 1 day up to 7 days max rentals is prolly to have extra fees from transferring shoes back and forth etc. Renters will only risk their rating which is not much/anything  in the beginning, they can always start a new account ...;2022-05-15 18:44:47;t3_uq8ndr;/r/StepN/comments/uq8ndr/in_the_future_why_would_anyone_rent_a_common/i8q5cyk/;1;[{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.6054728627204895}];Negative

1526;Individual_Guest1381;Man if you think selling code is bad then you are stupid. You want to buy sneakers for 1200$ make money everyday and you dont want to pay 30$ for code? It is one time very small money for you but people who sell 10 code for example, get 300$ and it helps them to get their invested money sooner. Nothing is free. I bought code when I was starting and didn't hesitate for a second becouse it is worth it. Also didn't find activation code for free every of them was used. So thank you people who sell codes and give us chance to make money with stepn.;2022-05-14 14:13:12;t3_ummev4;/r/StepN/comments/ummev4/if_you_sell_codes/i8ku29s/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.49132075905799866}];Neutral

1723;McMafkees;"&gt;I'm being as bullish as I can

Word of advice from someone who's been in crypto for 5 years now: do not be as bullish as you can, especially not when the market is uncertain. The current market eats people with this mindset for breakfast. Remember that even a solid project like Eth went from $1400 to $80 before it reached $4700.

I love Stepn and I'm using it every day. I think it's a very smart project with active devs who've put a lot of thought in creating a viable economy. But still, the issue is that the rewards of Stepn are highly market dependent. We've seen the rewards dropping like a brick the past week. In the summer of 2018, markets went down for 7 months in a row. Currently, we've only had a 2nd bearish month. There might be a lot more to come, especially seeing how the crypto market becomes more correlated to other markets which are also getting increasingly uncertain. I don't mean to be negative, I just want you to keep a cool head and to also take bearish scenario's in consideration. And for the love of god, stop taking out loans to enter the crypto market.";2022-05-13 08:50:47;t3_uocnwn;/r/StepN/comments/uocnwn/my_game_plan/i8fgsaf/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5669558048248291}];Neutral

I didn't see any penalty, but it will often put me in ""Moonwalking"" for the first few seconds after unpausing, done too frequently on a short run, I could see this as detrimental on your potential income.

1778;kmamidala;"No problem. You probably could. I doubt the app cares about 5 second pauses. The minimum on a walker shoe is 1 km/hr, which is pretty glacial, so I think you'll be ok. If you have a tricky putt or something you can tap the pause button.  
Where I am there is no way you can play a course without waiting behind approximately 8 million people and their strollers, even at 10am on a Tuesday morning :)

  
Sometimes I'll go out in my tiny backyard and garden and turn on Stepn. I don't earn as much that way, and pause it every once in a while when I'm stationary, and the app doesn't really seem to care.   


Another thing to keep in mind is your energy allowance. With one shoe you only get 2 energy (10 minutes) unless you spring for an Uncommon, which adds 1 energy.   
I think for disc golf, you're probably going to want to get to three shoes so you can get the 4 energy (20 minutes). So maybe buying a cheap shoe to try it out and make sure you can earn, and then adding another cheap shoe and minting for three, is your best bet.

1787;kmamidala;"I am very familiar with disc golf. The one thing you need to know about Stepn in a disc golf context is that you will need to pause the app every time you're not walking, which could become a pain in the ass. When you're throwing, waiting for the next hole, searching for a disc, waiting for others to throw, etc.   
The reason for this is if you fall out of the optimal speed range (when you're stopped, for example) it still uses energy but you're not getting any GST, and they have an algorithm that will actually penalize your earnings if this happens too often or your average speed is too low.  
Also, I don't know if you can pause a walk a bunch of times without penalty.

  
In your position, I would get a cheap low-level walker shoe, experiment with it using stepn,guide to see how much you should be making, and compare your earnings. If it ends up  working out you can buy another shoe to mint with, or sell the original shoe and get something better.";2022-05-12 19:01:04;t3_uo6wzh;/r/StepN/comments/uo6wzh/best_sneaker_for_disc_golf/i8cr9df/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7459778785705566}];Neutral

Of course that's just my opinion and I base that and the projects uniqueness. You know this when loads of copycat scam projects copy paste a good idea.

I think it's a good time for newbies to start this as the shoes are cheaper at the moment because of the price of Sol. 

But people have lost a decent amount of their portfolio of late with potentially more to follow, so the risk is always there. That's being said, getting in now is cheaper than before and is a great time to buy floor price sneakers and level them up yourself with your earning with GST being also down with the rest of the market.

The win here is when the market recovers you'll be earning a higher amount of GST. This means you could return your investment and keep your shoes for passive income and use that return to get some sale price blue chip crypto during the accumulation phase in 2023.

This all hangs on StepN surviving the bear market along with countless other projects.

1828;scenia;"Actually, the deceptive thing is looking at USD value. Imagine it was reversed, with crypto values rising like crazy. You could invest into stepn (let's say you bought X SOL for $1000, then put that into stepn), get a 10% ROI in SOL within a week, then cash out. At that point, if the value of SOL is 10 times what it was when you started, you'd have ""made back your investment"" if you look at USD value. But the truth is, you'd still only have made back 10% of your investment into stepn, while your investment into SOL increased tenfold. In that scenario, if you hadn't invested into stepn, you'd be sitting at $10k instead, so if you compare that to the $1000 you'd have instead, your actual ROI is still 10%.

In the current situation, imagine you made back your SOL investment into stepn in 25 days, but SOL was down 50%. Looking at USD value, you'd only be at 50% ROI, but the crucial thing is if you hadn't invested into stepn, you'd be sitting at the same amount of SOL, so the actual ROI from stepn is in fact 100%.

Bottom line, if you invest into something using currency X, but track your ROI in currency C, you're really mingling the ROI of the investment with the ROI of the currency exchange, making neither visible.

1836;rr7241;"It's fake :)

If you look at the webpage and compare it to STEPN, it really is way too simple and basic to be legit. But let me point out some red flags here:

* There's no clear and verifiable link to Asics as a company.
* Social link at the top are only pointing to [twitter.com](https://twitter.com) and [discord.com](https://discord.com), not to any real profile page.
* The number of minted shoes keeps rapidly increasing and this is done to put pressure: mint at this ridiculously low price because they're going fast !! But if you look at the JavaScript bundled inside this page, you will find that there's this function

`const Ki = setInterval(function () {`  
`if (+Ti.innerHTML &gt;= 3252) clearInterval(Ki);`  
`else {`  
`const t = Math.floor(4 * Math.random() + 2),`  
`e = +Ti.innerHTML + t;`  
`localStorage.setItem(""amount_stepn"", e), (Ti.innerHTML = e), (Ui.value = e);`  
`}`  
`}, 3e3);`

which generates a new random number and sums that to the starting one every 3 seconds and stops as soon as it reaches 3252, because they still want your money ;) If you reload the page the counter will be consistent, giving you the false hope that it is indeed legit, but again it's just smokes and mirrors: they persist the current number on the localStorage. If you simply log in with another browser, you will see different numbers.

`window.addEventListener(""load"", async () =&gt; {`  
`Li.parentElement.removeChild(Li),`  
`null !== localStorage.getItem(""amount_stepn"")`  
`? ((Ui.value = localStorage.getItem(""amount_stepn"")), (Ti.innerHTML = localStorage.getItem(""amount_stepn"")))`  
`: (localStorage.setItem(""amount_stepn"", 2431), (Ti.innerHTML = 2431), (Ui.value = localStorage.getItem(""amount_stepn""))),`  
`(document.querySelector("".mint-price"").innerHTML = ""2 ""),`  
`(Oi.innerHTML = \`TOTAL: &lt;span class=""total""&gt;${2 * Pi.value}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=""currency""&gt; SOL.&lt;/span&gt;\`);`  
`});`

Every time you access from a new browser (or you clear the local storage for this page) the counter will always start at 2431.

* The website itself is served through HTTPS and the certificate is issued by LetsEncrypt so it only means the connection is encrypted.
* If you run a quick whois against the domain, it will show that it's been created 2 days ago by a private person from Russia.

2.Make cross check  your deposit address are same.
3.Always send test amount like 1 or 2 usdc or what ever suit to you to loose.

Nobody has to worry about getting banned because STEPN won't even be aware that somebody on their app is doing something wrong. Selling and giving away codes aren't policy but when someone sells an account you take a stand for it? The account has no utility. It's an account that would be the same as someone getting a working code and inputting it in and then the account is just an account.;2022-05-12 05:33:51;t3_unte50;/r/StepN/comments/unte50/selling_already_activated_stepn_accounts_for_250/i8a8tw0/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5488943457603455}];Neutral

1893;Particular_Pickle798;"Hello mate, sure I can probably help a little with your questions.

1. As you said, can be predicted, but what I am sure of is that the current price of shoes is way below what it was a couple weeks ago. It already big sales. I would get as fast as possible since STEPN is about your account’s growth that takes times. 

2. First, choose your type of shoes that suits your speed best. If you can run for an hour above 8km/h, everyday then pick a runner. If that is not the case definitely pick a jogger / walker.

For any person starting this game. They should look at the same thing in a pair: efficiency and resilience between 6 ~ 7 to 10

Since you’re telling me you are here for the long run, I assume you mint a lot to extend your energies. Therefore, buy a pair that has 0/7 mints. Very important. 

Since you will be minting (breeding 2 parents sneakers to get a new one) you should also look at the sockets (the 4 locks around the sneaker). Try to find, on top of all the above, a pair that have 2 E at least, with R if possible. Best would be 3 E and 1 R. 

3. Once you get your first pair, level it up to 9 first. It will take you 45 hours. Now you should earn (if your pair is good) between 10 ~ 13 GST / day. The long term strategy is to cumulate these GST to the point where you can buy a second 0/7 mint pair (depending on the GST price, it could take a month). When choosing your second pair, find a pair that has the same E sockets as your main as it will boost the chance for your new pair to inherit this E sockets. 

Once you have these 2 pairs, earn enough GST (roughly 20 days) to mint your third pair. When it is minted. You will have 4 energies and earn double GST. Now you goal is to farm 6 more pairs to get to 9. Once again, if you are looking at long term, good account. 

After this you can come back to me and I’ll explain the minting strategy that will allow you to mint a lot quicker from from 3 pairs to 9 then 9 to 12. 

Hope it helped 👍 of course, by reading the white paper, you will get 80% of all you need to know. So make sure to read it on their official website.";2022-05-12 02:01:26;t3_un9tah;/r/StepN/comments/un9tah/what_is_happening_guys_is_stepn_is_safe_or_not/i89le0f/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5341653823852539}];Neutral

The weekly chart of BTC (driver of the market) has 6 consistent weeks of red. We are now entering week 7 which will confirm a bottom in the next days. 

STEPN is here to stay. Solid project, working product (app) and is following one of the biggest trends in the world which is health/fitness. This is still in its early stage and yes timing wise unfortunate but as with any investments made there is never a perfect time for it.

My advice, expand your portfolio with sneakers and bring up your daily energy. I think Sol might go down a bit lower but not much. If you started a few weeks ago this is the time to buy, dollar cost averaging.

1944;Chooky47;"Thanks for the shoutout!! 

I’ll list some basic tips I found handy to know, excuse the length! But this will give you some good info! 

- Sneakers cost GST, which is the local token, to level up. You get 4 points to allocate per level for a common, and once they are applied you can’t move them (at the moment). 
- When you buy a sneaker, you want to aim for as high an efficiency and resilience stats as possible. 
- if you buy one with the points already allocated (shown by green on the bar for that stat), you can’t change it. If they’ve wasted points on luck and comfort, don’t buy. 
- efficiency (how much GST you earn) and resilience (the repair costs) are important for making the best returns at the start, that’s your focus! 
- luck earns you mystery boxes which have gems, but you can only earn them if you have 4 energy or more (math reasons) so luck isn’t really important at first. Comfort is only for max level shoes / also not important for you now 
- base stats for common shoes are out of 10, aim for a minimum 5 efficiency and resilience 
- you get 2 energy at first for owning a shoe. 1 energy = 5 mins. It replenishes 25% every 6 hours. After getting a shoe, there’s a 24 hour cool down to start getting energy (to prevent shoe sharing). 
- if you own 3 shoes, you get upgraded to 4 energy. Uncommon shoes are hard to get and are expensive, but give you 1 extra energy too. 
- you have to repair your shoes each run, I recommend getting your shoes to 10 resilience, as resilience works in ‘blocks’ so it changes at 6 and again at 10. Moving from 7-8 for example, does nothing. 
- getting shoe to level 9 to begin with is good, because level 10 costs a lot more to upgrade, so many people stay at 9 unless they want to push more profit. 19 is the best cost efficient level and tops 9, if you want to push to it eventually. 
- if a shoe falls below 50/100 durability, it will earn less. I repair after each run, seems easier to manage. 
- you need SOL in your wallets in the app to make transfers. So you’ll need to send SOL to STEPN first. You get SOL on a crypto exchange such as Binance or coin base. After that you can fiddle with stuff, but that’s the first step, sol is having some delays so be mindful of that - and send a tester amount first to make sure you’ve done it right. Use the solana network for transfer when asked. 
- once you’re in, go to settings and profile, and make a password with your email. Handy to have if they update and you need to sign in - last time people got locked out cause it was jammed trying to send out emails for authentication.
- four shoe types. Walkers are a slow walk and earn the least, joggers are a normal/power walk and earn middle, and runners are a jog and beyond and earn the most. See how you go for pace! Trainers can go any pace, but they are expensive.

**ANNOUNCEMENT:** 

Hello @everyone . 

Here's a quick update regarding the MISSING ASSETS - CRITICAL CASES. (This is specifically for people who have had missing assets for 7 days or more, and have filled my Google form (https://forms.gle/44n52w9sSoYk3ZXL8). 

The form has received 839 responses so far, yet despite this number, I quickly noticed that a lot of the submissions are **UNRESOLVABLE** missing asset claims. 

**RESOLVABLE MISSING ASSETS:**
=====================================
**Generally, these are cases where assets were lost due to stuck/pending/delayed transactions.** This includes: 
🔹Buying/selling in the marketplace or in Magic Eden
🔹Transferring to/from wallet to wallet
🔹Transferring to/from the Spending account
🔹Minting when there was a network or node issue

These activities leave a trace of where the assets went, so we can trace and try to retrieve from there. 

**UNRESOLVABLE MISSING ASSETS:**
=====================================

1️⃣**LOGGED INTO THE WRONG STEPN ACCOUNT.** Member reports getting logged out during maintenance/update. The member tries to re-login, and see an empty inventory. **We can't resolve this because the resolution is to log in with the right email address.** The telltale signs of an incorrectly signed into account are: 
🔸you got logged out due to maintenance/update. 
🔸you check the run history under profile &gt; total distance, and the run history is zero, even if you've ran using STEPN in the past.
🔸you have given away activation codes in the past, but don't have any used codes in the activation code section.
🔸the email address you have logged in with has ZERO verification code requests from the past. 

2️⃣**ACCOUNT TAKEOVER (HACKING).** The situations vary, but the telltale signs of a hacked account are: 
🔸you are logged out in the middle of an activity, such as walking or jogging, and there IS NO MAINTENANCE/UPDATE going on. 
🔸there are verification code requests in your inbox that you did not request for.
🔸someone has requested your verification code/seed phrase via DM in any social media channel, or even via call. 
🔸you remember going to a website where you were asked to log in using your STEPN email address, and/or asked for your seed phrase. 

3️⃣**INVALID REPORTS.** Members responded to the form even though their assets were missing for only a few hours/for less than 5 days; members are reporting a non-missing item issue; member's response is unclear; member's details are lacking. **These submissions will be de-prioritized** over those with complete/clear missing asset issues that are older than 7 days.  

There are a few other missing asset reports that do not fall into any of these categories, and I'm still crunching the numbers.

1963;kmamidala;"With transfer speeds varying wildly, it can be hard to respond quickly to the changing market and random Stepn announcements.  
A couple of things I've done to help myself-

1) Keep some coins in your spending and wallet, whatever is appropriate for your strategy. I keep GST and GMT in spending and some SOL in wallet, because I'm leveling up and minting shoes. If you're buying shoes, you'd keep some SOL in spending. I know nothing about USDC. 

2) Try different means of transfer to the app.   
Yesterday I was trying to send SOL from Coinbase (which has worked the last three weeks) and it wouldn't go through. So I bought GST on Coinbase and sent it instead, and it went through immediately (but this hasn't worked in the last three weeks)

1990;macsoft123;"It depends on your concept of ROI. The best mindset in crypto is to compare altcoins to your strong coins, instead of USD. 

Like I don't care about LTC/USDT for example, but I do care about LTC/BTC for example.

So if I invested 13 SOL, and I believe in SOL, my ROI is when I get 13 SOL back. no matter how much 1 SOL is worth in USD now or then when I invested it in STEPN. So you best timing for for trading GST for SOL is when the chart (comparison) GST/SOL is high. If you trade on those highs, you'll get more SOL for your GST each time.  

So since there is no native GST/SOL chart on tradingview, you have to insert the above formula so you can get a GST/SOL comparison chart. if you trade GST for SOL each time the 1h chart is overbought, you are always getting more SOL for your GST each time. 

So after this drop we've had on BTC dragging all alts went down, we are still comparing GST to SOL and not GST to USD. the GST/SOL comparison chart just got a spike last hour, and that was a greart place to trade GST for SOL";2022-05-11 14:16:04;t3_una1ru;/r/StepN/comments/una1ru/got_my_only_shoe_14_days_ago_got_roi_today/i86qo5p/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6711326837539673}];Neutral

2009;Orihisoy;"Welcome to Stepn! I suggest you try using the app without getting a sneaker first - just to kinda understand how it functions and get a sensing of how fast you can actually walk comfortably.

If you are able to walk comfortably at 4km/h (i.e. without it turning into a jog), then go for Joggers; otherwise, Walkers.

1) Go to marketplace and filter accordingly to sneaker type.

2) Filter level and mint according to your preference. Without going into too much details, a lv5 with mint 2 or 3 is a good place to start.
(Note: I personally recommend buying a lv19 if you have the budget for it. I believe the premium is worth it.)

3) Browse and look for sneakers with base stats of Efficiency + Resilience &gt; 12. To check base stats, click on the 'Base' button. You want to prioritise getting a sneaker with high efficiency.

4) Luck and Comfort are good to have, but not necessary for your first pair. Same goes for sockets. I personally believe there are many opportunities to upgrade along your journey (if you ever start minting, you'll understand why).

2062;move2earnphysio;"**Today is talking all about ankle stability and how to avoid twisting your ankle**  
  
It is one of the most common injuries in the world. Most people have twisted their ankle at some point and could have challenges with ankle stability.  
  
Once you do it once, it is much more likely to happen again.. and again.. and again..  
  
Building up strength in the foot, ankle, leg and hip is key to avoiding future injury.  
  
Balance is also key to injury prevention.  
  
To train balance, just like strength, you need to gradually progress it.  
  
You can do that by:  
\- Changing to softer surfaces  
\- Moving your other limbs, drawing alphabet with your leg or juggling with your arms  
\- Moving your eyes around - works well to watch the balls you are juggling  
\- Closing your eyes  
\- Adding cognitive load - e.g. counting backwards by 7s from 100

2080;SliceOfHumboldt;"I'm in the US and not a tax expert but as far as I understand it and based on information from my accountant any time that you earn cryptocurrency (as apposed to buying it) that is considered income. Then when you sell it you are supposed to pay capital gains taxes if the price you sell at is higher than the price you receive it. Aside from the appreciation or depreciation of the GST and GMT earned in the game there is also the value of the NFT's (sneakers, shoeboxes and gems) to consider. For example if you sell a pair of sneakers for more than you bought them for I believe that would technically be subject to capital gains taxes. Here is a list of the taxable events related to StepN as I see it. 

\-Using Solana to buy sneakers, sneaker boxes or gems - subject to capital gains tax

\-Earning GST and GMT - taxed as ordinary income

\-Using (burning) GST and GMT - subject to capital gains tax

\-Receiving gems or GST from mystery boxes - taxed as ordinary income

\-Selling sneakers - subject to capital gains

\-Minting new sneakers - taxed as ordinary income

\-Trading any in game asset for any other in game asset - subject to capital gains

\-Selling any Solana, GST or GMT that is transferred out to exchanges - subject to capital gains  

Many of these are happening every day, multiple times a day and for some high level users most or all of them could be happening every day, multiple times a day. As you can imagine, keeping track of all these transactions and the price or value of each asset at the time of the event would be difficult if not impossible. 

If anyone would like to try this spreadsheet could be helpful.

When Stepn team posted that message, GST was at $4.05. But an hour from that writing that message, it was $3.94. So was that a pre written message that was an hour old? Or did they not check the latest price at the moment of that post? 

I don’t know, but in any case, I’d go with the general guidance that they posted. I don’t think that will change for awhile. And as far as the mechanics of how they will change the minting cost, I’m not sure. Arguments can be made for both cases. One can argue that the prices will automatically change and that’s why they gave us the GST price formulas beforehand so we are not confused. Or one can argue that even with that general guidance, they would still give us periodic announcements of changing prices.

2205;Big-Community-8710;"We've got 2 tokens GST and GMT, where the second one is the governance token. Your earning potential GST to GMT is 20:1. Eventually GST will drop a lot in value and GMT will raise, then many people would prefer to earn GMT.

Once when we've got this clear, to the second part. GMT market cap is around 2 bn and its tradable on the exchanges. Considering the marketing potential and the hype around this project its safe to assume that some big investors will pay attention and trade the token heavily to keep the price fair and somehow stable. 

The GMT daily cap is 15 tokens per day (MAX), so most likely you'll earn 1-2 GMT per day and we as a community wont be able to affect the price that much in the beginning.

This project could easily last a few years and get tens of millions members. The only issues are that they need to constantly bring more new members to offset the selling pressure and the other issue is that crypto is cyclical (when is dead-its dead)

Now are STEPNs tokenonmics strong enough to consistently award people the same amounts long term as we have been accustomed to? Probably not, but they’re the first to tap the retail/non crypto crowd with their product which in turn gives access to huge amounts of liquidity.

If they continue to build and develop more burn mechanisms, then there’s no reason to believe to think we’ll have a sudden crash like you see with other NFT projects in the short term as there is still such a huge demand from new users.

2277;hearsdemons;"1. Don’t use the Stepn app functionalities to send Sol from Binance to Stepn. Go to the Stepn wallet and copy your address. Now go to your Binance account then paste that  Stepn address to your Binance withdrawal. 

Couple of noteworthy points about transfers. Don’t send too much at first. Send a single or fraction of Sol to make sure it is going to your stepn account correctly. Secondly, solana can at times be congested or shutdown. It can take hours or even until the next day before you receive your Sol into stepn. Once your Sol arrives at Stepn, you will need to send it from your Stepn wallet to your stepn spending wallet to be able to buy shoes with it. Again, sending things between your Stepn can be anywhere from instantaneous to several hour wait time. 

2. The cheapest shoe is about 13-14 sol. Make sure that the shoe your buying fits your lifestyle workout. Walkers make the least amount of money but are the easiest to use daily, runners make the most money but you will have to run at a high speed every day or else you won’t get laid. Joggers are the happy medium. Also, you want the base stats of the shoe to be good (at least 5 in both efficiency and resilience). Ideally, you want the efficiency to be 7-10 and resiliency to be 5-10. The other two stats don’t matter to you daily gst earnings. 

3. Make sure you get a ledger as soon as you can. And once you start getting paid daily and you choose to cash out instead of leveling up your shoes, that you send it to your ledger cold wallet.

- the ecosystem (preventing high volatility by making IG functionnality hardest to accomplish)
- the newcomers (keeping floor price around psychological roofs, like 1k$)
- the actual players (keep an 'acceptable' daily income, to prevent massive cashout)

- harder mint (not more expensive, but harder). It seems that the scolls system is related to that.

2357;freak_0o;"Mich würde auch interessieren ob da jemand von euch schon mit einem Experten gesprochen hat. Sofern ich das bis jetzt richtig verstanden habe, dann muss man auch ganz klar zwischen Staking und Mining unterscheiden. Aber die aktuelle Rechtsprechung kann bei weitem noch nicht mit der sehr dynamischen Entwicklungen im Crypto-Space Schritt halten

Nach der aktuellen Einschätzung im Netz handelt es sich beim Mining um eine gewerbliche Tätigkeit, da hier **nachhaltig**, **selbstständig** und mit **Gewinnabsicht** gehandelt wird - [Besteuerung Mining](https://www.winheller.com/bankrecht-finanzrecht/bitcointrading/bitcoinundsteuer/besteuerung-mining.html)

Beim Staking kann das Prinzip der **Selbstständigkeit** zumindest angezweifelt werden, was wiederum gegen eine gewerbliche Tätigkeit spricht - [Besteuerung Staking](https://www.winheller.com/bankrecht-finanzrecht/bitcointrading/bitcoinundsteuer/besteuerung-von-staking.html)

Um was handelt es sich jetzt bei StepN? An dem Punkt bin ich auch überfragt - ich würde hier aber eher Richtung Mining tendieren. Durch den Kauf des NFT's kann man nachhaltig und selbstständig GST erlangen, damit dürften alle Voraussetzungen für eine gewerbliche Tätigkeit erfüllt sein. Aber evtl. kann hier ja jemand mit Fachwissen weiterhelfen.

Aber ungeachtet ob eine gewerbliche Tätigkeit vorliegt oder nicht, nach meinem Verständnis müssen trotzdem alle Transaktionen dokumentiert werden. Und jeder verdiente GST muss als Einkommen mit dem Zeitwert in der Steuererklärung deklariert werden.";2022-05-08 10:50:48;t3_ukx955;/r/StepN/comments/ukx955/taxes/i7s87k7/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6987836360931396}];Neutral

2359;Frequent-Eagle-4728;I asked for help from within the application, but there was no response. Please help I am in a very difficult situation. I lost all my assets. I have repeatedly received a verification code to my email address. 15 verification codes were sent in a row, then I entered the stepn application and tried to change my password. But the app did not connect me, I tried again and again. Then I went into the app and there are no shoes. Looks like all my assets have been sold. Solana Fee is not in the account. Someone may have hacked my account and sold the shoes and withdrawn them to their own address. I had trainer level 5 shoes with id #941564299. Before this happened I had 0 solano in my spending account and shoes in my account. He is no longer in the shoe spending account and has 0.16 fades. Someone hacked my account, sold my shoes and took the money. He linked the money or shoes to my account in his own wallet and uploaded his address and sold the shoe or money to that address. Because there is no exit money transaction in my wallet. I beg you help! It had been 1 day since I entered the system and deposited the shoe money. Unfortunately I'm done. If a new wallet other than my wallet was connected to my account, he stole my shoes and money. I don't know how, there is a huge security hole and it happened to me in just one day. If I had sold the Shoe, the money would have been in my wallet. Please examine my account in detail, you will see how it is. Someone entered my account without my knowledge or bought shoes or sold shoes in the market, tied their own wallet and took the money from that wallet, this is my money.

I clicked on the ""GPS Status"" app and start walking and waited until it locked on a GPS signal, when I saw that I clicked on STEPN app and hit ""run"". It took only 2 seconds to lock on the GPS signal and got a red bar just 2 times for maybe 5 - 10 seconds. End of my run I lost only 0.08 GST comparing to 1.8 to 1.9 GST I was loosing  before.

2382;yonks;"🌟 NEW FROM THE CREATORS OF STEPN (AMA - MAY 7, 2021)  🌟 

⚡ In the near future, according to the creators of STEPN, a balance will be established between the prices in the Solana and BSC networks in the game. More people are migrating to BSC soon. They believe that many more sneakers will be minted soon on the BCS network even without additional events.

⚙️ The team has worked on improving transactions. Worked out the dynamics of Nodes. The system is now fully operational. The speed of transactions between Spending and Wallet has increased.

⚡ Genesis owners in the BSC network (*sneakers with numbers from 10,001 - 20,000) will also be rewarded in the future.

🐼 A new design of Panda sneakers is coming soon. It will only be available in May. The ability to crush this can be obtained by burning gems. This design will not provide in-game benefits other than beauty, collectibility, and rarity. In the future there will be sneakers with other animals.

🔥 The game will introduce the mechanic of burning sneakers to get a sneaker with improved performance. It will be possible in this way to create the “perfect sneaker”.

⚡ The next update of the application will be a transitional step to the public version. The game will have new rules.

⚙️ So far, there is no mechanic in the game that keeps track of who exactly walks / runs with the phone. But it will definitely be added in the future.

⚡ App update coming next week.

📜 A new NFT is coming to the game!
The Mint Scroll can be obtained in the game as a drop at the end of the walk. It will be necessary, for example, for mint Common and Uncommon sneakers. The Luck will not affect its loss. Only the amount of energy spent for 1 walk. This innovation is aimed at combating ""farms"" that only deal in mint.

🪙 There are no plans to make a bridge between GST on Solana and Banance in the game yet. But technically it can be done. It will probably appear when GST prices are equal in 2 networks.

⚡ According to the creators of STEPN, Trainers earn randomly between Runners and Walkers. But Barndog (the game's Australian ambassador) claims that Coaches earn more than runners, or the same, based on aggregate statistics.

🪙 GMT can be transferred in the game from one network to another.

🪙 STEPN cannot prevent the GST token from being listed on exchanges.

🪙 Over 60 million GMT have already been burned. About 3-6 million tons of fire are burned per day.

⚡ New filters in the store in the application will appear no earlier than June.

⚡ STEPN employs more than 100 people.

⚡ Phase IV in the game will last 2 months.

⚙️ The game already has a mechanic that will not allow 1 person to earn for 1 walk with 2 phones at the same time. At the same time, the mechanics do not affect the earnings of 2 people walking nearby.

⚙️ Transaction log will appear in Spending soon.

Also when Gst price was around 8$ i converted to usdc and when it dropped i just bought it back cheaper 😂.

2386;fatbutbald;"When using 0.5 energy you actually get 0.6 energy, giving you extra GST. 

Here is how I do it: Refill times for me is 08:00, 14:00, 20:00 and 02:00.

I chose to run 08:00 and 20:00, so when I want to start this strategy I use up all my energy at 20:00. Then watch some movies and go to bed.

At 02:00 I get 0.5 energy, but I just keep on sleeping. 

At 07:30 I wake up, get a coffee and 07:50 I put on my shoes, go outside and start Stepn app. I still have that 0.5 energy from 02:00, so I run until it's gone. Takes 3-4 minutes. 

Time is now  07:58 and I'm out of energy. So I stop stepn app and close it, and catch my breath for 2 minutes. 

Time is now 08:00 so I open my Stepn app and see that I have another 0.5 energy in there, so I run until it's gone.

Then in the evening I do the same, (but might have some beer instead of coffee) 😎

This strategy let's me use a total of 2.4 energy instead of 2.0. Repairs are a bit more expensive (8 units instead of 5) but I net between 1-1.5 GST extra per day. (Level 9 jogger, should give about 12.31 GST with two energy according to stepn.guide but gives about 13,5 - 14 with the 0.5 energy strategy)

BUT I AM ALSO OLD AND TIRED, so sometimes I oversleep and miss my morning thing. Perhaps I wake up at 12 (with 1 energy already in my account). So do I panic and start running using up my 1.0 (bonus free) energy? Nope. I wait until 14:00 when I get another 0.5 energy, so that I have a total of 1.5 energy. Because 1.5 energy is counted at 1.6 so I get that extra bonus 0.1 energy. So THEN I go running, right? Nope. I wait until 19:45 and THEN I go running spending my 1.6 energy BEFORE the refill at 20:00

At 19:57 I'm all out of breath, so I stop and close stepn app and rest for three minutes.

Time is now 20:00 and I have 0.5 new energy that I use, and get paid for 0.6

So I slept in, ran only once (in the evening when it's less hot), got to take a break, and used and extra 0.2 GST, netting me av extra 0.70GST compared with running it in one go with 2.0.

GMT has a daily cap of 15 tokens per day, while GST has 300 tokens daily cap. Again over time GST will drop significantly and more people will try to get to the highest levels and opt in for GMT earnings. The ROI will decrease also, therefore its good that we are on board early

For example when GST drops below 1$ and GMT is trading above 15$, Instead of making 40 GST per day, you'll prefer to get 3 GMT per day.

GMT market cap is massive and the daily traded volume is more than 1 bn while GST is sitting at around 50 million. Theres a many big whales trading GMT daily and you can assume that we cant affect the price that much while earning a few tokens per day.

2476;Overall-Butterfly331;"Long term I don't see it as a Ponzi and here's why: 

I initially dismissed Stepn because I thought the buy in was too high, then realized I'm an idiot because I walk everyday anyway, for free.  If I can invest some money up front to monetize daily walks for what I hope is at least the next year or two then why the hell not?   
I know the time will come when I'll only make a few bucks but that doesn't matter to me, I'll still be out there walking everyday.  There are millions of people who do the same thing, walking or running is a daily habit already so Stepn is just fun and not intended as another degen play. 

Once earnings go down dramatically this will be the core group who continues to use the app and will be a great demo for marketers IMO.  I was a massage therapist for 12 years and in my experience people who run everyday tend to be affluent.  These users will need real sneakers, are willing to invest in their health and have disposable income. 

Yes I can understand why people see it as a Ponzi short term especially if they aren't people who already have a daily habit of walking or running, IMHO.";2022-05-07 15:32:16;t3_ukdzbs;/r/StepN/comments/ukdzbs/prove_me_wrong_stepn_is_a_dialed_down_ponzi/i7oqycr/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.4990577697753906}];Neutral

1) of the pool of users, how many people can actually exercise daily and meet the energy requirements?   


2) if all people do is cash out, wouldn't that just drive down GST price to a new equilibrium?  


3) The way I see STEPN is like this: 100 people pool in $100 and thus you've got $10,000 in the pool. Based on how much you exercise in relative terms to the other 99 people  is how much you'll make. Thus, the more you've run compared to others the more you'll make while others will lose money. In some sense it's like an indirect bet against others on how much you can exercise relative to them.

2482;scenia;"Stepn actually doesn't strictly require new members to work. Since the tokens and NFTs are freely tradable on the open market, money can enter the system through the medium of demand (and thus appreciation) on the secondary market. While this essentially just shifts the blame onto the crypto/NFT market, it means stepn isn't inherently any more of a Ponzi than crypto and NFTs in general.

Now there's a very strong argument for NFTs specifically being an elaborate Ponzi scheme, and I agree with it, but as a previous commenter pointed out, our entire economic system is technically a Ponzi scheme with extra steps, so yeah...

It should be noted that with leasing on the horizon, there's actually a planned feature that entirely removes the buy-in requirement, which would instantly collapse a classic Ponzi scheme. But since stepn is only a Ponzi to the extent that the market as a whole is one, this ends up being fine. Do expect prices to tank rather massively once that releases, though. We'll experience a partial collapse then, and anyone who joined shortly before will need quite some time to break even.

GST and GMT are the tokens of STEPN. This is how you earn money. The in game coins if you prefer.

Not knowing about GST yet thinking about investing in STEPN is quite scary… 

As a general advice: don’t just invest in projects because everybody talk about it, or because you saw some hype. Luckily STEPN is a legit, good project. 99% of crypto project don’t succeed, and most of them are scams too. 

So please, go on official websites, read white papers, check their communication channels (discord, Twitter) look at the community there.

2499;TheScienceBoy;"I was wondering about this today too. I think it's to do with daily cost in durability.

As you level past a certain threshold for Resilience (around 12, according to what you say), you only lose 4 durability instead of 5, for each daily allocation of 2 energy.

When you split your walks into four 0.5 energy sessions, you lose 2 durability with each walk instead of the loss of  5 durability from one long 10 minute walk. Totals a loss of 8 durability for the day. I've confirmed this myself.

But, according to what you've described, when you've leveled up Resilience to the point where you'd lose only 4 durability per day, it seems each 0.5 energy walk only costs you 1 durability.

I think the StepN guide calculations are based on doing the walk in one hit and doesn't take into account splitting the energy into multiple sessions per day.

I'd be interested to see more detailed analyses if you have any. :-)";2022-05-07 12:13:10;t3_ukbjfy;/r/StepN/comments/ukbjfy/stepnguide_calculators_not_always_right_heres_the/i7o3ie9/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7871982455253601}];Neutral
2500;hearsdemons;"We are well aware of the delicate nature of designing a robust, thriving economy. As STEPN explodes in popularity, we’re quickly becoming a virtual country ourselves. That comes with all the complexities of designing a monetary policy for a country in real life.
That’s why we look to examples of who have come before us — even real-world historical examples, such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis — and carefully study ways to avoid economic meltdowns. In the play-to-earn space, this sort of hyperinflation, which leads to a “doom cycle” of asset devaluation, has already occurred several times.
The most prominent example is Axie Infinity, which saw the price of SLP, its in-game currency, plunge over 90% in the past several months.
Axie has pioneered the play-to-earn space and paved the way for all other x-to-earn startups. Unfortunately, it’s facing inflation challenges now, driven by the fact that more players are cashing out their SLP rather than reinvesting them. With insufficient demand, the token is expectedly depreciating, which drives even more players to cash out into more lucrative stores of value. As a result, mass capital flight ensues.
So how are we setting ourselves apart?
For one, we’ve been diligent in designing the game to be inherently fun and positively addicting. And we encourage users who are there to, not just earn tokens and NFT rewards, but strengthen their relationships within their communities (walking together and leveling up sneakers together).
This presents a hedge against those who are only walking to earn as much as they can and then cash out their earnings (which drives inflation). In other words, we’re ensuring a vast majority of the STEPN community aren’t just here for cash — they are here for all the other intangibles — better health, better relationships, and better mood.
Secondly, we have plans to roll out features beyond just breeding, repairing, or upgrading sneakers that will address the delicacy of move-to-earn tokenomics. The GMT token, for example, will also be used as a way for users to vote on donating to carbon offsetting programs and we plan to integrate social-fi elements that go beyond move-to-earn, adding more value to GMT and building in more robust use cases for the token. And we’ve also built in key incentives, known as “game sinks,” for users to retain their assets and continue to reinvest in the game.";2022-05-07 12:06:37;t3_ukanve;/r/StepN/comments/ukanve/highly_recommend_reading_this/i7o2w98/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7334485650062561}];Neutral
2501;Particular_Pickle798;"First and foremost, investing in crypto always has a certain lvl of risk. M2E is difficult since it is easily compared to (often rightfully) as a Ponzi. 

Now, I am 12 pairs in, earning good money everyday (350$/day) I could cash out but the game is so well done that I keep reinvesting in it. 
Minting more shoes to get rarer pairs, upgrading my gems to boost stats, building a GMT farmer and a MB farmer… and not all the features are out yet. 

I participate in every AMA’s and events online. The founders are very aware of what they are doing. They have analyzed previous m2e and p2e. They are fully invested in the project. They personally answer the community’s questions. They choose amazing ambassadors. And they react very quickly to situation that could harm the sustainability of STEPN. 

For sure, earnings will drop in the future. GST was not meant to make you earn so much. So current players are benefiting from this. But even if GST drops at 2$, 1$. With GMT pumped by many burning mechanisms. It would be a great investment. Much better than any other NFT projects you see out there and more reassuring than just coins trading.

GST is not the type of token for long term investment. It has to stay at lower price otherwise, floor prices will be to high so hard for new players to join, and profit will be so high, people will start cashing out instead of reinvesting. 

STEPN will make sure it won’t happen, so the game can sustain for long. 

GMT though is what STEPN is focusing on. The governance token. They will release 2 uses cases every 2 weeks for a total of 10 GMT burning mechanisms. 

That includes higher chance of upgrade gems, boost % chance of double mint, extend earning cap and more.

Compare this with a stock, say a subscription business.

I like Stepn but breeding is a problem. the sheer number of sneakers that will eventually be in the market will diminish their value. If every user can breed then the potential supply is infinite. Eventually supply will be far greater than demand. People will have spent time and money investing in their shoes but they will only be worth what someone is willing to pay for them. The more shoes in the market the more difficult it’ll be to sell and that will lead to a reduction in sneaker prices.

If you’re in early enough you’ll probably be fine but I wouldn’t be basing my investment strategy on the thought that the sneakers will continue to increase in value.

2584;Ok-Judgment-9172;"You can use this link to calculate the costs for each plan:   
[https://stepn-calculator.netlify.app/](https://stepn-calculator.netlify.app/)  


but: 

plan A: Mining: 

the cost of leveling up your runners to 5 and them minting right now is 12.12 sol /and you will probably get another runner which you don't want. So you have to sell it on the market and the floor price for a 0 mint runner right now is 14 sol. then there is %6 tax so you will have around 13.1 sol. A 2 mint jogger floor price is around 12.5 sol. so you will be +0.6 sol.

Assuming you want to pay for minting cost using your earning and again assuming you are making around 20 gst daily with 3 sneakers, that will take you around 10 days to cover the cost. ( with gst and sol prices right now) 

but now you have 1 more mint with the minimum cost. 

Plan B: Getting from market: 

the floor price for a 2 mint jogger is around 12.5 sol which again assuming you are earning 20 gst daily, it will take 10 days for you to cover the cost. 

The decision is yours to make.

2587;MEPHiSTO6666;"I would say even if people burn all the GST they have earned in the app and the supply goes down as a result that doesn't necessarily  change the price. Its supply and demand as you say so only if people on some exchange where GST is listed now (like FTX) buy it for speculative reasons (most likely because they don't know enough about STEPN and the tokenomics - because if they are bullish on the project they would buy GMT) or if STEPN users sell SOL or USDC to buy GST as minting is attractive it goes up. If people cash out the GST they have earned vs. SOL or USDC then GST will go lower.  
If demand for shoes holds up into a GST drop then minting becomes more profitable (as the cost to mint goes down while sneaker prices stay the same) which should lead to people buying GST to mint or at least stop to sell the GST they have earned).

Worst case is that sneaker prices and GST both drop so there is no supply from minting and everyone just sells.

Later in the game GST will be supported by GMT. If GMT is worth more than GST and people can earn GMT they will level up to L30 (and burn both GST and GMT in the process) and then switch to GMT earnings and therefore reduce GST supply.

so the Devs put a number of balancing mechanics in the game but in the long run people need to keep buying sneakers  and spend GST (and GMT) in the app rather than cashing out otherwise there will be more and more GST tokens and no buyers of them so the price will drop";2022-05-06 16:29:19;t3_ujl0zj;/r/StepN/comments/ujl0zj/can_anyone_eli5_what_causes_the_gst_prices_to/i7km21x/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7703062891960144}];Neutral

2643;kmamidala;"No problem!   
There do seem to be a lot of weirdos and scammers swirling around this project- but honestly, I've seen that with many projects, especially new ones. I think this one might be attracting more than its share of scammers because it's the first major one in the FitFi/ Move2Earn space, and the thieves want a piece.  
People's sneakers and accounts being hacked is awful, although we don't know the whole story. Did they click on a suspicious link in an email? Freak out and try to contact the nonexistent ""chat support""? Minding their own business and super unlucky?   
I personally haven't experienced this and my heart breaks for those who have gotten hacked or scammed. I imagine there will be more transparency down the road regarding the shoe wallets and whatnot.  
Transferring SOL from Coinbase to my Phantom wallet (Ledger backed) takes about a minute, and then same to Stepn. It's been really fast for me.  


Leveling does take time. 60 minutes per level. That is, going from 0 to 1st level costs 1 GST and takes 60 minutes, going from 1 to 2 costs 2 GST and takes 120 minutes, and so on. Level 5 costs both GST and GMT, as does Level 10.   


You cannot use your shoe while it is leveling. It is best to do this immediately after your run/walk.

2647;Fine_distinction;"Great to hear, thanks! I am a bit worried that things seem to be done in a black box in the off-chain StepN wallet - I always imagined that it will be on a blockchain, that we could sea every transaction etc.

I love the concept, but I am worried about putting any serious money into it - there is a ton of reports of things missing from people's account and the number of scammers around the project is terrifying, never have seen anything like that. That's why this email-code wallet seems such a bad idea, they could use 2FA apps on the phone. 

What do you think of numerous report of people being hacked? the only good think about hacking steps account is that NFTs don't have values beyond the system, so hopefully devs will help resolve that? and coins we can keep in a proper wallet.

Thank you very much for explaining how the things works, I assumed that now that GST and GMTs are listed, will be easier to buy them directly on the exchanges, but will do what you recommend.

I'm not trying to shit on Coinbase, I can only tell you I have waited days to send GST or GMT only to have it never reach its destination and refunded to my account (after I filled out a support ticket.)

2654;Fine_distinction;"Thanks, very good explanations! I am familiar with crypto, but not Solana.

When you trade GST inside of a STEPN wallet, can you approve the rate? or just click convert and get whatever system will get you? especially with current volatility and potentially low liquidity at times, I was thinking that using a highly liquid exchange like Coinbase would be better. And Coinbase clearly can clearly receive GSTs ok, that how they started trading them.

wrt the code, I worry about bots, not sure if they can operate on a phone, but on a computer, knowing somebody's email, it is super easy to break a 6 digit code.

Do we know if there are bots in STEPN? eg selling and buying bots? I never kept anything valuable on a phone, so was not researching how easy is to automatically trying to break passwords on an iPhone app.

You seem to know Solana very well - do you think it will be able to withstand traffic if STEPN will become as popular as we hope? or can they just add another chain, like BSC, for example Polygon? current situation is worrisome with items often disappearing and users having 'items lost in transaction"" for days, devs even created on discord a special ticket for people who cannot recover their assets for more than 5 days .. and Solana's very low costs may not be such a blessing, with DoS attacks and network spamming";2022-05-05 21:55:18;t3_uj42ei;/r/StepN/comments/uj42ei/before_you_ask_for_a_code/i7hazpo/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.53391033411026}];Neutral

2671;Exotic-Caterpillar70;"You need to value the fact that you can level three sneakers at the same time.  This has significant value...if you focus on leveling all the sneakers up at the same time then you will have three high-performing shoes in a couple weeks that will perform at 6 energy vs 4 energy.  I believe this to be most profitable if you have the risk tolerance to be a long-term holder.  

I've correlated this to a game of digital real estate that incentivizes you to put capital back into the deal to generate higher returns at a later date.  This is not exactly apples to apples but it plays out like this.  The sneaker is the house/the NFT is the land, GST is the bank, offering debt and interest, GMT is equity.  Solana is the dollar that buys the house.  If you level up the sneaker (pay GST), you are paying off the principal of the loan that you borrowed from the bank.  Now if you get an interest free loan (ie don't level up your sneaker) then yes in the short term you will cash flow nicely, but you are not building equity in the house unless the market has no inventory.  This is not California 2022, this is California 1849.   
Since we know there is a lot more housing supply (shoes) to hit the market, the price of sneakers will stay somewhat stable as they slowly introduce demand and counter any supply imbalance with minting events.  I believe we can estimate where we are on total shoe supply by the amount of GMT that has been released into the market.  When you get to level 30 GST earnings turn into GMT, which is like saying your house is now paid off, now you are in the equity.  If the ratio of equity (GMT) to debt (GST) gets out of whack, ""the fed"" or stepn in this case will put in temporary policies to help the economics to stabilize and not throw us into a recession.  Minting or ""wear and tear"" leads to the depreciation of the asset.  Just like in Monopoly, the goal is to own as much real estate as possible.  I believe Stepn is building towards that in their rental model.  Just like someone who owns a lot of rental properties, the goal is to create passive income/mailbox money.  Now some people will say but you earn GST, how is that debt.  Well GST is like the money you're borrowing from the bank to get the shoe up in value.  You have to constantly spend it to increase your position, similarly you constantly spend money on your mortgage to pay down the principle.  And every once in a while you make capital improvements, new roof, paint, etc (ie spend GMT, equity) that is required at leveling up during level 5, level 10, etc.  Oh and isn't it interesting that the price of GMT and GST has been floating around the 35%/65%  ratio lately?  This is a typical equity to debt relationship on your basic commercial real estate deal.

I've thought about this too much.  I really enjoy the game theory.";2022-05-05 17:29:37;t3_uivqj1;/r/StepN/comments/uivqj1/you_are_allowed_to_use_multiple_accounts/i7g7qn3/;1;[{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8971258997917175}];Positive

You can definitely set an account for your wife. You may either transfer you Sneaker or purchase a Sneaker from the Marketplace to get her started. If you are worried on the possibility of account sanctions due to the fact that you and your wife walk together, please note that as long as you have individual accounts and using different devices, it will not be counted as multi-accounting.

2892;hearsdemons;"I don’t know. I don’t think anyone knows. Let’s just go off what we do know. 

1. Stepn has 2 coins, GST and GMT. GMT is capped at 6 billion coins and GST is unlimited. Long term, this means GMT will be more valuable over the long term. 

2. Stepn has first movers advantage is this space. It’s the first major move to earn crypto project that has reached this much success or scale. We’re at 300k members and still growing by the day. This means even if other move to earn projects come along, it’ll be unlikely that they’ll be as big or successful as stepn. Which means stepn could be here to stay for a long time. 

3. The most comparable project to Stepn, in recent years, is Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go has 81 million active monthly users and 8 million active daily users, and has managed to stay alive for 6+ years now. 

4. The difference between stepn and Pokémon go is that with stepn, people’s initial investment is on the line. If we’re assuming the 300k members as of now each have at least 1 shoe to play the game, and the cheapest shoe costs $1,200, that’s $360 million locked up in the game just from people starting out in the game. All of those people will almost certainly continuing playing until at least their initial investment is returned. That creates a cycle of 1-3 months just for everyone to get their investment back. Which means there will be a lot of active users for at least the next 3 months for anyone who’s just starting out now.

5. If Pokémon go did 6 years when no money was involved, Stepn can do at least that when people’s incentive is that they will be paid. 

6. No one knows what will happen to GST. What we do know is that developers are very keen that GST doesn’t get too high so that the game stays beginner friendly. GST is being kept cheap, and with the minting, shoes are being kept cheap, so everything costs next to nothing for someone just starting out. Because the devs are very hands on with changing the rules of the game to not allow a coin to skyrocket, I don’t see GST going above $10. GMT on the other hand is limited supply so I see that going higher than $10 long term.";2022-05-03 18:47:08;t3_uhm4zr;/r/StepN/comments/uhm4zr/gst_to_120_by_2024/i76zifa/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6273944973945618}];Neutral

2924;CallItNothing;"Hi! My name is Taylor, and I recently got involved in STEPN because a friend actually mentioned it to me. 

I would be farther along, but since I’m a runner and got so excited when he first told me, I tried to figure it out on my own that night and ended up losing over $4k to a scammer that privately messaged me in Telegram. 

It was my fault. I should have known better. 

Anyways, it looks like I’m set up to buy my third sneaker at the beginning of next week, which will give me four total energy. 

I am trying to get to nine sneakers as quickly as possible because I have no problem running 6miles daily. 

Long story short, I’m wanting to know if you’re familiar with a way to boost my energy before I actually get to 9 energy. It seems like the only way would be if someone loaned me sneakers to get me to 9 energy and I paid them a percentage of my daily GST earnings until I minted up to 9 sneakers, myself. 

The issue with that, of course, is there are so many scammers and it would be incredibly risky, understandably, for someone to loan another person sneakers that they met over the internet. That being said, I’m very trustworthy and obviously not a scammer. Are you familiar with any way where I could connect with people who could verify I’m a real, trustworthy person who runs a lot? It just seems silly not to earn for 45min or 60min each day, when I CAN actually run that long and someone else might just have sneakers in their wallet that they can loan to earn some passive GST. My thinking is that with each new sneaker I mint, I send back a sneaker to whomever loaned me one. 

Just to reiterate, I’m not a scammer; if you feel uneasy about responding, please feel free to ignore this message. I just happened to have this Reddit thread show up in my inbox, and I figured it wouldn’t hurt to send a message. 

I don’t need an activation code, obviously, as I’m already part of STEPN and have two sneakers. Please feel free to reach out if any of this sounds interesting. I’d be willing to send a picture of my ID or anything to verify who I am. 

Like, on one hand, it seems silly not to partner up, but on the other, given the nature of crypto and te fact that someone would basically be transferring/loaning $6k of assets (6 sneakers) to someone and it being completely up to the person they are sending them to to be trustworthy, pay the percentage of GST AND send the sneakers back, I completely understand why it doesn’t happen. 

It just seems like it would help both parties a lot, should they trust each other because the game is set up in a way where, say you have between 15 and 30 sneakers, the extras after 15 aren’t really being utilized until you reach the next energy threshold. 

My friend did this with me - he loaned me two sneakers for me to have in addition to my one, so I could earn GST faster to mint a second sneaker using mine and one of his. I paid him 25% of my GST earnings while I had his sneakers. He just needed his back though because he reached a new energy threshold. 

Anyways, if anyone is interested, please let me know. Again, I was hesitant to post this because of all the scamming going on, but I figured it was worth a shot, given that I am not trying to take advantage of anyone. It just seems like a potential win-win situation.

2949;move2earnphysio;"Yep!

It's completely fair enough that people are getting excited about the app and all the earning potential. But, that will only be feasible if people take looking after themselves seriously. 

There are very valid arguments for the positive effect an app like this could have on global health, but musculoskeletal injuries are a major burden on global health too. As is made very clear by the issues with opioid pain-killer addiction around the world. 

Most of that is due to inactivity, but one reason people become inactive is they go down a spiral of injury, initiated by doing too much too soon and developing a bad association with exercise. 

There are biologically set adaptation periods for different tissue types (muscle adapts faster than bone, cartilage, ligaments etc) and you just ignore that unless you want to end up injured. Particularly for people who have done very little running in their life and/or are on the older side. 

I do like how the app has built in ways of making it progressive by limiting energy for new users. But, if you go all in, especially on a runner, it could get pretty unsustainable for most people. 

Anyway, I hope that all the people getting into STEPN and move to earn take this seriously because if they do, it will be a great thing for individuals and for global health.";2022-05-03 10:17:57;t3_uh8ltp;/r/StepN/comments/uh8ltp/i_am_a_marathon_running_physiotherapist_and_i/i754lyk/;1;[{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8393600583076477}];Positive

Long story short - a guy called Algo likely is long algorand which is a subpar chain compared to Solana - he is butt hurt that a game like STEP'N is doing so well.

2. Satoshi test (send small amount to make sure funds arrive and you're not stuck waiting anxiously for hours) USDC from stepn to phantom
3. Deposit from phantom to binance (make sure you have at least 0.01 SOL for gas in phantom + chose the SOL network when extracting the binance wallet address)
4. Optional: move funds to any other defi/exchange where you can stake your usdc

Notes:
- You could also just send the sol/gst to phantom and convert on any other decentralized exchange that supports gst - e.g. raydium (more likely for conversion to work right away, but slightly lower rate, at least for gst/usdc on raydium yesterday)

You can get 3 shoes - mint and walk longer if you want.  I would sell the 1 mints and upgrade new shoe to live 5 and mint again.

3011;Rilthalas;Hello, would appreciate getting a code please. Just started to learn more about crypto, Blockchain and P2E games and Stepn caught my attention. This is definitely one I would love to try, reading a little into it looks like I will need to invest in a sneaker and then earn token by moving around. I'll be able to reinvest those tokens by upgrading my sneakers and then hopefully get more sneakers and try minting. Earning while walking is definitely a new concept. I guess my only worry is being able to afford a sneaker but I think I'll have enough;2022-05-03 02:26:17;t3_ugoak3;/r/StepN/comments/ugoak3/i_dm_a_code_for_free_every_10_energy_i_spend_just/i73z631/;1;[{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9538787603378296}];Positive

It turned out many people stepped back because they didnt know the entry cost is like 1200$, that's a win for the community not to have ""ghost"" user who signed up and never buy a shoe.

Some people are just to lazy to tell their story and I couldnt care less for them. Maybe they prefer to compete over bots in the discord and telegram channel rather than having a genuine interaction between human.  Made some online friends along the way, and of course they can ask me questions directly regarding the apps.

The community should always be welcoming so it can grow in a positive direction and hopefully more and more people are doing this so stepn community can become a healthy one.

3. You haven't lost anything until you seek your Nft and stop playing (eg. Lock in your losses).

4. If you can't handle some swings in price or losing your investment then don't enter into crypto. Most projects fail. 

5. Don't go complaining that you are down and expect that to positively impact your situation. A new comer may read your misinformed opinion and be convinced to not get in.

3641;polkamonx;"&gt;everyone saying “Don’t panic” is the first sign that I should panic.

The people who tell you this are the ones got in early, those are the ones who actually made money (still making most of the money on this). Same as all other ponzies like bitconnect or helium, regardless that probably tens of thousands will get completely wrekt on these projects the early investors always make a killing because the new nabs fomoing in paying their dividends. In the case of stepn this is acronym with the sky high price of the shoes and the increase in the token price.

I don't panic because I haven't bought a single sneaker after realizing what a megaponi this project is but the more days pass the more and more articles like this will pop up because you cannot hide the truth and this project will collapse like a house of cards. Right now all those who downvote these posts, instaban you from tg/discord are either project affilates or early investors who protecting their own bags.

They don't care about you or anyone else being rekt, they don't give a fly fk and saying anything bad about this project will make them start attacking you right away even if their argument is flawed or doesn't make any sense. 

Regarding the VCs they are like WCs in crypto. Just look at projects like Bluezilla who creating these launchpads like ethpad, adapad, bscpad, velaspad making people buy an insane amount (in some case of SOLRAZR like 50000$ worth of their junk token) to get a 100$ piss allocation in a new IDO and they say you will make your investment back in no time.... All of these projects with no exception are rugged and collapsed, all those who hold their tokens lost their money forever.

You should be extremely careful with any kind of crypto projects whether that is NFTs, crypto mining, or gaming like this with sky high floor price promising a quick and fast roi. It will work out for some people while thousands if not tens or hundreds of thousands will get completely rekt.

I myself decided NOT to buy any sneakers but made a good amount of money daytrading GMT/GST. Even any of these tokens I closely watch and wouldn't hold more than a couple of weeks.

3939;WorkItWallet;"Thank you! The minting odds for trainers are actually quite different than other sneakers, so I wouldn't recommend minting trainers with hopes of receiving a new trainer. When you mint 2 trainers together, there's actually only a 25% chance of receiving a new trainer (more detail in [this table](https://www.workitwallet.com/post/stepn-minting#viewer-ea1fl)).  


From there I think it all depends on your risk tolerance. If you'd be comfortable spending the amount of SOL on an uncommon, then it's not necessarily a bad idea. But I got mine through minting commons, which was a safer route in my opinion. It requires a lot more work to keep minting, but as I mentioned in this post there are lots of profits to be had from it right now. And I'd say the same for a rare sneaker, just more extreme haha. I personally don't know when I'll feel comfortable minting uncommons just because there's such a high chance to receive a common and take a big loss.

In short: transfer your coins to a wallet that orca.so supports, convert them on orca, then transfer them back. You'll pay a little more gas but it's still negligible.

4069;Finally-Here;"I've been thinking a lot about how this doesn't come crashing down in the future. Great [article](https://cryptonat.substack.com/p/stepn?s=r) from Nat Eliason where he speculates on potential use cases. One thing he mentions is using GST/GMT to ""flex"" socially; maybe spending GST makes your shoes look cooler, promotes your experience on their future social network, etc. etc. Maybe people are willing to pay for that stuff later. 

I've also been thinking about real-life utility, maybe spend GST to pay for your marathons w/ special perks, etc.

Ultimately they have to figure out use cases that aren't just about making money. As this grows, if everyone is just incentivized to make money, \*eventually\* it will turn as supply overtakes demand. Demand can't keep growing forever and forever, but I agree we're early and it's going to grow for a long time from here.

We will see. Hopefully Sequoia keeps them honest ;)";2022-04-28 16:15:01;t3_udw5ap;/r/StepN/comments/udw5ap/gmtgst_prices/i6jsk60/;1;[{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7973517775535583}];Positive
4070;MomentGlittering4527;"I'm in crypto for 5y and never have I seen a token price acting like GMT/GST. Completely opposite of the market and skyrocketing. It did acctually happen with DeFi and ""alternative blockchain"" such as Sol so I believe Stepn could be a new web3 trend that is starting to catch. Also Stepn is engaging with a lot of people, a lot more than any other p2e crypto game, since it is about walking/running, unlike Axie for instance. And the invitation code system allows people like my mum and dad (who don't know shit about technolgy let alone crypto) to be engaged and invest their money. All of that gets us to a hugher Gst/gmt price.

I'm also interested to see where it is headed, because even at $4 i was like wow u shouldn't earn that much $ for a single walk. Now it is 50% more!

Earlier today I bought my first 2 joggers. I bought two in hopes to mint a 3rd to bump me up to 4 energy per day however I am not sure this is the most effective way to earn GST. Should I level one of my shoes to level 9 then try and mint a new one? If so which one? I also saw the 125% strategy but it does not look to be very effective with only 2 energy at the moment.

4212;WorkItWallet;"Hi - I wrote an article about everything to look for when buying sneakers (link below). You generally want to look for a sneaker that has solid Efficiency and Resilience stats if you're looking to maximize earnings. I'd generally look for something with base Efficiency + Resilience of close to 12 or higher.   


When you look at sneakers in the marketplace, some will have gray bars for the stats and some will have gray+green. If the latter, that means the prior owner leveled up the shoe and allocated points to those stats.

Don’t jump erratically into it, calm yourself down, breathe, try to release the energy of anxiety, create some clear mental space before going further. Stop thinking about the money, whatever happens don’t ever come back to the money. Take it as a mistake/miss understanding/system error that you’re trying to undo because it’s the right thing to do.

4271;Useful_File7483;You are 100% right! However, that's why we educate ourselves, why we analyze at least similar cases, listen to people around, on social media, the developers, we spot the problems and challenges, how the creators overcome them. Also general trends are very important. It's all about probability, and always something odd may happen that we can't predict. However, that's why we diversify, don't allocate all funds in only one high-risk asset, why we think about breaking even first and then how to secure the gains. Investing should never be seen as gambling, and always from the point od view of probability (that we want to increase on our favor). StepN is a high risk investment, with promising and high ROI (approximately 30-35 days is enough to have the NFTs and the amount invested returned), but it will not last forever, and for sure many people will be mad due to lost funda for reasons such as investing too much (what they can't afford to lose) or too late...

The way I see it, there was the very early adopters phase Dec-March, the early adopters phase started this month in April and will likely go until July/August, and then StepN will probably remove the activation code constraint and it will go to mainstream with several big brand partnerships. The target audience is literally millions of users (but I agree that by then shoes and GST will probably need to go down a bit). Then I see it running a steady state as more and more people see this as a fun game and a great fitness app to motivate people into a healthier lifestyle.

For sure, the revenue today is much to high. Crazy high. But i think they know what they are doing, if at this point it is Not sustainable, they would have cut the earnings.

For example, if you transfer SOL earnings out of StepN into an exchange (e.g. Coinbase), are you taxed on the amount as regular income? If you then later sell the holdings in Coinbase for fiat currency, are you taxed again for capital gains? And what would the cost basis be - $0 since you earned the coins in StepN or the price of SOL when you first transferred it into the exchange?

I generally keep an eye on these channels:

1. Announcements
 - only Stepn uses this for announcements. No flooding of unnecessary chatter
 - link to announcement around the wallet issue (nearly 24 hours since I posted, I do not believe they have announced this as resolved yet).  https://discord.com/channels/890163015561932840/907818005902295120/967083048069894235

If the base stat was, let’s say 6, you would not only save 5 points (difference between your 1 R on this shoe and the example) on building up the resilience, but you would be able to add those 5 points to efficiency. 

The earnings would be very difference, using the STEPN guide will show this. 

You don’t have to take my word for it, but if you are looking to earn, efficiency and resilience need to be as high as you can get.

4443;summernight9;my thoughts are Stepn is a potential projects. It seems like similar projects will likely copy them and Nike, Adidas will jump in? Thus, in the short term buying a shoes right now is quite profitable because of high ROI, it's still very new, and they don't really have many strong competitors right now. Just my opinion but i think this is a good change to learn the market and we will have many more chance once Nike, Adidas jump in.;2022-04-23 13:43:28;t3_u9vn4v;/r/StepN/comments/u9vn4v/when_is_the_rent_option_coming_live/i5vkvj0/;1;[{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6763575673103333}];Positive

**I accidentally transferred USDT to my STEPN wallet, what do I do to get it back?!**  
**🔹At this time, USDT is not supported/visible in the STEPN wallet.**   
  
However, below is a workaround that you can try to see your USDT in your STEPN wallet.   
  
⚠️ Please back up any PHANTOM/STEPN wallet addresses and seed phrases before proceeding with these steps. STEPN will not be held liable for any losses incurred in our attempt to help you get back your USDT. ⚠️   
  
1️⃣ Install a FRESH Phantom app extension into your Google Chrome or Firefox browser. (If you already have Phantom installed in your browser, DO THESE STEPS ON A SEPARATE BROWSER that does not have Phantom installed yet, so as not to touch your existing Phantom wallet/account.)  
2️⃣ During installation, Phantom will ask if you want to ""create a new wallet"" or ""I have an existing wallet"". Choose ""I have an existing wallet"".  
3️⃣ The next window will ask for your seed phrase. Type in your STEPN wallet seed phrase, which are the 12 words given to you when you created your account. (In this window, words should be typed in the order that they appear in the STEPN window; there should be no numbers, all small letters, each word should be separated by a single space).  
4️⃣ The next window will ask which wallet address you want to import. Look for your STEPN wallet address (just look at the last 4 digits of your STEPN wallet, then look for those last 4 digits in the list).  
5️⃣ Your STEPN wallet will now be connected to Phantom. If you have USDT in your STEPN wallet, it should now be visible in Phantom. While in Phantom, use the in-app token swap to convert your USDT to USDC or SOL.  
6️⃣ Once you have performed your USDT/USDC/SOL conversion, close/reopen your STEPN app.   
7️⃣ Your USDC or SOL should now show up in your STEPN wallet when you look at your STEPN app.";2022-04-22 06:46:25;t3_u97u61;/r/StepN/comments/u97u61/i_transfered_usdt_to_stepn_wallet/i5pxd5n/;1;[{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5086199641227722}];Negative

4546;marcus095;"You may have read it, but did you understand it?

Yes sure there's a liquidity pool, so there are many people buying GST to upgrade, mint and open boxes quicker.
But let's not forget why all of us are playing the game: to earn money for walking/jogging/running. Some people already went out walking/running so the only difference now is that they can earn money for it. But some other people, me included, go out just to earn money.

If there's nobody left buying into GST because everyone wants to cash out, the token falls and the project will be dead.

Let's be real, the sneakers nft have no real value other than earning GST/GMT. Stepn isn't generating value without player investors. Without new players buying sneakers, stepn isn't receiving commissions and old players can't cash out of their nfts. If no new players join, nobody will buy GST and old players will be left with little to nothing.

So is it a ponzi? Basically yes, it's just one with a long lifetime.

And I say all this as a player, but I already cashed out more than I invested and I keep on earning for the time being. But let's not fool ourselves, the prices of GST and GMT will eventually drop to such small values that people won't be incentivised to join or keep playing.

It won't happen that soon, but I'm pretty sure next year the situation will be a lot different. And if I'm wrong, well I don't care, I cashed out and I'm ok with it even if I lose potential for more gains.";2022-04-21 12:46:15;t3_u8k04t;/r/StepN/comments/u8k04t/where_is_the_gst_coming_from_im_new_to_crypto_and/i5lyz75/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7561593651771545}];Neutral

4596;Beneficial-Spring279;"Hi - Yeah agreed, I'm a fan of this Reddit community!

That's my setup too currently (with walkers though). Those earnings generally sound right, but if you want to be sure you can use this [Level Up Tool](https://www.workitwallet.com/post/stepn-level-up-tool) to see your current and future earnings based on the stats of your shoe (shown in the Earnings tab after you input your stats)

I'd expect the earnings from the uncommon to be higher, yes. Both because it's an uncommon (higher stats) and a runner (which earns more GST per minute). But that again depends on the stats, so I'd recommend using the tool linked above to check earnings at current and future levels.

Going to at least Level 9 typically makes sense for most people. But this could be higher with an uncommon, depending on your goals. If you want to see what the optimal level should be based on your current shoes and your goals, you can use this [Earnings Calculator](https://www.workitwallet.com/post/stepn-roi-calculator).

Well atm the avg is around $1200. I bought two sneakers weeks ago for an avg of like $1050 so they've become a bit more expensive now.

&amp;#x200B;

When you run/walk you earn a token called $GST (Green Satoshi Token) which you can find on CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko to track price of it. It has been ranging from $4-$5 the last few weeks. It has multiple uses and there's also $GTM which is the governance token but well I highly suggest you read the whitepaper, it is very friendly and lots of info in there.

For exchange, what I do is I swap my GST tokens for USDC in any dex on Solana like Raydium or Jupiter Aggregator. You just go there, connect your wallet and swap the token for USDC. You can also do this from the stepn app but I don't like it that much. After that you can transfer your USDC to any exchange that supports USDC or USDT deposits through Solana network and then you are good to go and transfer it to your bank account.

I'm not from the US so I don't really know the whole tax thing with crypto earnings but it's pretty simple to withdraw the funds you earn walking.";2022-04-18 20:23:09;t3_u6jmvu;/r/StepN/comments/u6jmvu/gifting_sneakers_to_friends_and_family_have_you/i5944ns/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6136828660964966}];Neutral
4673;NoirValley;"Appreciate the detes, thanks!

On average how much is one sneaker costing in USD? 

As they run/walk what token are they earning? $STEPN? And what exchange can US peeps use to cash out / exchange it to ETH or BTC? Or is this another instance where Americans can only watch from the sidelines?

4674;QCO1226;"Yup! I've done it. I mean I got experience in the nft game so for me it was pretty simple. I actually bought one for my mom and one for my gf. If you are new to crypto or nfts it can be a bit scary but it's really simple.  
You just need to transfer the sneaker from your spending wallet to your main wallet and then have your friend/family create a stepn account and wallet and then just send the sneaker to their main wallet and they just need to send the sneaker from main wallet to spending wallet and they are good to go.

They'll need to wait for energy to refill and they won't be able to mint with that sneaker for 48 hours... just some info that is good to have prior to doing the transfers.

Anyway, if you got any questions you can hit me up!";2022-04-18 19:40:03;t3_u6jmvu;/r/StepN/comments/u6jmvu/gifting_sneakers_to_friends_and_family_have_you/i58xn2p/;1;[{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.780031144618988}];Positive

4724;APTECHTV;"Thank you for your comment! 

I do know quite a bit about networking (but not cellular) 

I think the ""networking switching"" is done more by my phone's operating system than the app, unless the app monitors my IP address and MAC address then obviously switching connection will give me a different address. You know how when you switch WiFi connections the app you're using automatically grabs the new network and says ""back online"" apparently stepn doesn't do that?

The app uses GPS to track speed and movement, and the gyroscope to track the authenticities of the runs. it does require some network access since I don't think this process is done locally but more with their machine learning model and comparing my data to their data. 

It is also quite tricky to find a balance between hand movements, I like to run as stable as I can so my AirPods don't fall out. But it seems like the app wants me to shake my phone more than I prefer to earn credits. But at the same time, if you're shaking too aggressively then it could be misinterpreted as cheating. Really hard to find a balance of that lol

I would prefer if I can have my hands free and have the ability to put my phone in my backpack though since I already carry water with me in my bag.";2022-04-17 21:16:01;t3_u5vvqc;/r/StepN/comments/u5vvqc/investors_beware_my_dumbass_thought_this_app_will/i54o5py/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6060686111450195}];Neutral

True - the optimal level will increase if you're starting at a higher level. That's because there will be less level up costs when you start at a higher level.

So I would recommend starting with the [Earnings Calculator](https://www.workitwallet.com/post/stepn-roi-calculator) and entering your current stats to see what optimal level you should get to over time.

How to change this dynamic? By introducing an external source of income that buys GST. 

And now the question has born: who in earth would like to buy global people's health and movement? 

When STEPN creators find those source of income (governments, public figures, global donations, health foundations etc) the scheme will be sustainable.

4869;Nios_Cabron;"If you're searching for examples and guidance, how to earn as effective as possible, I did some research for a while and right now I own 3 Sneakers, but only using 1 of them as my ""Cash Cow"" - it's the Common Trainer with 1-20 km/h earning range.

Here's my game plan so far (no financial advise, please do your own research!):

1. Bought 3 Sneakers (2 cheap ones, just to get 50 % more energy level = 2x earnings with your main shoe)

2. Chose Main Sneaker, that costs more and gives more (in my case, as mentioned, Common Trainer) with Base-Attributes as high as possible, but one thing is very necessary! From high (1. Efficiency 2. Resilience) to low (3. Luck 4. Comfort).

Also relevant for me: comfort is actually not able (0 %) to give anything back of my efforts.
The whitepaper of STEPN tells, this feature is in progress, whatever that means - couldn't find any date of publishment, so far. 

For me, it's not a good plan to seek for comfort (haha it's also a statement of ""Yes Theory""), without knowing any date of possible outcome.

Little knowledge part: Comfort-Attribute = for earning GMT, which is not possible before reaching lv 30 - keep that in mind! GMT could be an great investment in the future, because it has a limited supply of 6 billions.

Maybe in the next months, I'll adjust my strategy, 'cause of announcements to a near publishment. Then, my strategy could be, to buy another shoe (LV.5) with highest attributes in comfort. 

'Cause of the already high earnings of GST/day with my main shoe (then LV28, see Earnings-Calculator), it could be levelled up in a very short period of time and you only have to convert a bit of GST to get another bit of GMT in the STEPN wallet, which you'll need to burn to get to LV29(30).

After all that, you could get in the glorious role to choose either GST or GMT to produce in a high rate.
Just watch, which coin is more expensive/efficient at this time? Mhm you like that imagination? Me too ;) 

3. THE key factor, which influences my strategy very strong, is, using CALCULATORS to optimize earnings/find goals, that suit my habits:
in my researches, I found 2 very attractive Calculators:

No. 1 STEPN Earnings-Calculator 
&lt;&lt;workitwallet.com&gt;&gt;   
There's also a Shoe-Minting-Tool on that website, that answers the question: ""when is it a good, or a bad deal to mint?!""

But the Earnings-Calculator, is THE best tool, in my view. It has the abilitity to keep you on track, just because it will make you greedy - give it a try.

You can set the actual level of your shoe and attributes + a time horizon, how much days you plan to earn GST. 
Then type in sums of investment and how much sneakers you own.
It will generate the days till ""return on invest"" (RoI) and also net earnings. 
If you type in the actual LV of your Sneaker, it will consider this and gives you back the RoI in return.
Very helpful feature, in my view.

My proposal: check the applied GST-price of the calculator, by switching the currency settings ""GST"" and other choice of currency, like for instance ""USD"", and divide them to get the applied GST-price to the calculator.

No. 2 STEPN Guide -&gt; it is very helpful for optimizing the sneakers-attributes for each and every level.
You can play yourself with the settings to get a feeling and enjoy its worthiness.
&lt;&lt;stepn.guide&gt;&gt;

For me, these both calculators are perfect in combination.
You can see and review your goals everytime, by using the Earnings-Calculator.

Before I make a silly mistake, because I set wrong attributes after levelling up, I use the calculator, that gives me the optimum settings for earning as much GST (Efficiency) and keep as much of GST (Resilience) as possible.

I consider to adjust my strategy, if GMT-earnings come into place.

NOW Guys, have fun and maybe we'll all get rich at the optimal state ;)";2022-04-13 12:11:26;t3_u2o653;/r/StepN/comments/u2o653/my_stepnstrategy_efficiencycalculators_no_ads/i4k09d1/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7271546125411987}];Neutral

On top of that, sneakers are born from breeding two vintage pairs. It costs 200gst for the first mint. 
The floor price of sneakers will always follow the mint price; Why sell at 25$ a pair you minted for virtually 1000$ ? Or even 500$ or even 200$ (say that gst price dropped)

The luck factor into getting better stats, or rarer shoes, when minting, will push people to constantly mint, burn, and sell as well.

I’ve purchased a second shoe, and am now saving to mint a third. I’ll be happy at 4 energy and three shoes, since I use runners I earn fairly well, so that will be me.

4919;cnjUOc6Sr25ViBvC9y;"I'd say that buying physical shoes which come with a STEPN NFT is a logical place to take STEPN, but keep in mind the app is still in beta and it's very early days still. 

It's helpful to think about the value proposition to a company like Adidas / Asics: they're almost guaranteed to quickly sell all of the physical shoes which would have a STEPN code inside (assuming there aren't millions of them available). They'd also be able to sell the shoes at a higher price point due to the added value of a STEPN sneaker being included. 

They haven't announced anything officially, and I don't think they will/can until the STEPN app is well out of beta and they've had months to plan production with whichever shoe company they partner with for it, but as long as things keep going well and user growth is strong, I think it's very likely we'll be able to buy physical shoes with a STEPN shoebox inside eventually. 

I'd say the affordability part of your question is largely solved with the ""rental"" system, whereby you'll earn 30% of the GST/GMT earned when someone uses your sneaker to go for a walk/jog/run (leaving 70% of the return for renter).

4973;BuildingBlox101;"There's a lot of delusion in this thread. The ROI will NOT stay at 1-2 months for STEPN. In no way is 600-1200% ROI sustainable for thousands of users. Many people here saying that ""the devs have a plan for keeping GST prices high"" which is another way of saying that you are running on hopium. Maybe GST prices will fall, or maybe shoe prices will skyrocket or maybe the devs will lower the amount of GST earned per run/walk/jog.

The fact of the matter is that at some point STEPN will hit a point where more users are withdrawing their crypto for income rather than reinvesting it. It's a simple supply and demand problem. With everyone selling their GST to cash out there will be more sellers than buyers, thus pushing GST prices down. Right now we are in the opposite side, where people are holding on to so much of their GST and burning it keeping the supply low. But eventually people will want their money back and that's when this project will lose its insane profitability.

Now don't get me wrong, I think the project won't collapse, but we may see a reduction on ROI time to 1-2 years, possibly more. Even in that scenario its a crazy good return if you compare it to the stock market benchmark of 10%

Personally, I would say this project probably will retain its good profitability throughout the rest of this year and in fact, as long as there is new users joining then maybe it could be sustained. But for comparison, the Discord had about 40k users when I joined a couple weeks ago, now its at 120k+. I think its possible that we could see that expand to 1mil but that's entirely speculation.

5174;Beneficial-Spring279;"**Leveling Up**

I agree that it makes sense to get to L9 with your primary shoe. That being said, it's worthwhile to level up the sneaker with the best base efficiency and resilience attributes. I assume that's probably the one you're using as your main?

Level 10 has certain benefits (it unlocks your 2nd gem socket + you're able to lease it when that feature becomes available), but this also makes leveling to L10 significantly more expensive (30 GST instead of 10 GST). 

**Minting**

If you're comfortable investing another 400 GST to mint those 0 mint sneakers together twice, it would be worth it. There's a ""twin"" minting event going on right now, which doubles the odds that you can receive 2 shoeboxes from minting (it's not clear what these odds are, but I'd roughly guess it's around 10% during this event).

Just as important, you could mint for 200 GST as mentioned above. This is currently about $950 USD. New sneakers on the market are selling for around 10-11 SOL (depending on whether they are walkers, joggers, runners). That's about $1,300 - $1,400 USD at SOL prices. So you could mint new sneakers and sell them into the marketplace to make a few hundred USD if GST and SOL prices stay consistent. I built a calculator to demonstrate these saving [here](https://www.workitwallet.com/post/stepn-buy-vs-mint). If you input the types of sneakers you are minting (and the # of mints they have), you can see roughly how much you could make by using this strategy.

STEPN converts money into movement, and this means global health. That seems to be the only value of the app.

The problem is that STEPN does not generate a value that is commercially exchanges into money, and as the only motivation of the users is to earn money, and the money only comes from people that wants to earn money this generates an unhealthy Ponzi scheme.

The only way to correct and make this sustainable is to generate new sources of money. 

So the only question would be:

Who wants to buy global health and global movement? If the team find agents and corporations that do this, GST will be sustainable.

5191;mariohpc;"STEPN works because of the GST (and ultimately GMT) value.

Of course, GST value depends on the buying pressure.

And buying pressure depends on the interest new users and current users have on improve their sneakers in order to earn more in the future.

As far as people invests more, GST price would be maintained. This is a classical Ponzi scheme.

No one of us would be earning one dollar if people wouldn't be looking to increase their earnings.

The paradox is that you increase future earnings when you burn/buy GST. This generates a positive upward chart, slightly influenced by BTC price and team's promos (like double mint event).

All of us are walking hard in order to recover our investment. But you have to say it clear: the last one holds the bag. GST value will decrease if no external situation is generated.

Greed and optimism gives value to GST. When more than 50% of the STEPN users reach the best level available with the maximum energy available, the GST price will start to go down.

Also the number of NFT sneakers will progressively increase (due to the high circulation of GST generated from nothing, only from the worthless movement of the users) because people will decide to increase the minting business, until sale price in solana minus royalties go down to equal GST minting costs.

We are all very optimistic, getting fit, and amazed from the earnings that an NFT generates. This is the same astonishment an early ponzi applicant has when receiving the first results of the investment.

Team members say sustainability comes from constant GST burning. We cannot accept that. We more would be saying ""delay in the crash"" comes from creative GST burning processes.

But not all is negative in STEPN. 

STEPN has thousands of users that each day move for money. This means you can convert money into movement/global health. I don't know which industry would benefit from this, but I think:

1.government health programs to reduce medical costs
2.A private version of STEPN financed by private business and available only for their employees (this amazes me)
3.public brands that release a portion of their annual gains into mundial health improvement. For instance, you buy a Nike shoebox and a 0.05% goes to finance GST Tokens, so that it pays the movement of global people, regardless the borders and place.

I feel a little bad thinking about the ones that will arrive late and will lose money with this.

I see that activation codes and roadmap extends the life of STEPN, but my worries are there.

If I were the team I would urgently go for two goals:

1. Extend the life of STEPN ecosystem by reducing the earnings per level and increasing gamification GST costs (this will help second goal that is the only one that matters here)
2. Create a new evolved version of STEPN that helps any user to create healthy dynamics to the ones he or she wants. For instance: In a family, I have two children, I want them to do sport, I create a STEPN private branch for them, and I pay for the GST they generate. Another example: I am HP, the big printers company, and I want my employees to be healthy and efficient. I know the value of their health and I release a private branch of STEPN only for HP employees. They can run, walk and go for their GSTs and with those GST they can either earn money (paid by HP) or festive days -free from work-, also with internal rankings inside the corporation.

Just ideas.. I don't know what of I thought can be of help. Best wishes for everybody!";2022-03-31 10:52:54;t3_tsa0ts;/r/StepN/comments/tsa0ts/how_is_stepn_not_a_ponzi/i2tyy37/;1;[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.763698160648346}];Neutral

5311;Future_Maintenance55;"Thanks for your inputs. Yes actually i plan to have 3 sneakers so that gives me 20 min worth of GST everyday. The sole reason is 10 min is probably too less for me when i almost jog for 45 min everyday anyways without Stepn.  
To me Minting a new shoe is exciting since it gives you additional shoe however it doesn't matter much when it does not led you to change your tier where you get more energy. So in other words , if somebody has three shoes, minting a 4th looks exciting but doesn't increase your base GST given that you need to burn a hell lot of GST to mint. So better have one shoe at high level rather than 4 at lower level. Also probably the one shoe you keep on investing and levelling up will help you recover your initial investment faster that way. Just my thoughts.

Anyways i already made my purchase for a 2 mint shoes but it totally makes sense to buy a 0 mint if possible given the nominal price increment. I was too eager to buy so bought it but will keep in mind when i buy the second one. thanks";2022-03-16 10:19:36;t3_tfco8t;/r/StepN/comments/tfco8t/wondering_ways_to_effectively_choose_my_first/i0vdo8g/;1;[{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6522305011749268}];Positive

5336;Mod_Gilgamesh;"Interesting read.  


I just wanted to respond to a few lines in your article:   
1. this game is not free to start, unfortunately. since these games promise the ability to earn money they would not make it easily accessible to everyone. --&gt; I am yet to see any cryptoproject that lets you start absolutely free. If a cryptoproject is completely free, then nobody will invest money into that cryptoproject, therefore killing it.   


2. A good piece of advice I got from a youtube video when assessing projects is to check their Reddit account for traffic so i did. The number threw me off a bit because on Reddit they have 1k plus in their community and I thought to little because discord has 50k. --&gt; Cryptoproject communities are built in Discord, not in Reddit, largely because Reddit is only a forum while Discord is a voice, video, and text chat app. And the largest cryptoproject on the planet, Axie infinity, has an Official Reddit with only 100k users, even though their official Discord has 800k. Based on your assessment, ""that seems strange right, huge discrepancy.""  


3. it seems that it only tracks your movements if you have the app open and internet which is a bad design, I don't want to always be stuck on this screen while I am walking so the developers could work on that. --&gt; You don't have to keep the screen open; you can just switch off the screen and walk/jog/run, and STEPN will continue counting your steps (assuming you don't have battery saving options that will kill STEPN's operation if the screen is idle).

5357;ShingleShangl3;"You seem genuinely misguided/misinformed, so perhaps I'll dial back on the snarkiness and attempt to share morw with you.

You have basically formed a very cursory impression of Stepn from your experience with Axie. The reason Axie is failing now, is because they did not manage the earlier stages of the game well, causing hyperinflation as SLP supply far exceeds demand. 

I will first, like to clarify that in order for a game to become a ponzi scheme, older players need to get to a point that they stop using the in game currency and are cashing it out at as rapidly as they earn it (I'm sure you are familiar). Until that point comes, the game is not considered one, as even older players are still pumping in money. Will it become one? That all boils down to how the team continues developing the game, but they have given no reason for us to doubt their capabilities. 

Stepn's team has carefully studied these games, and using them as a blueprint, improved on the mechanics to ensure there are enough ""sinks"" in the game to ensure there is always sufficient demand for the currency. Of course, we're in early stages of the game, and tweaks are necessary as we progress, but fact of the matter is the team has more than proven themselves to the community with the rate they are rolling out updates to improve the game experience and protect their existing user base. 

The team never priced any of the game items themselves. Early movers were given free shoes and the market set the price on its own. 

You say 6 (actually it's 9) SOL is expensive. I'll agree it is if you look at the price exclusively. But with 9 SOL, you basically make back your investment in about 2 months at current market prices. Even if you throw in a buffer for price fluctuations that's 3 months max. 

Is the game guaranteed to succeed? Of course not. There's always a risk to putting in money when we're this early. So far, the team has shown they are incredibly competent, and make decisions with the community in mind. 

That is not to say the game's currency will never trend downwards. It certainly will as we onboard more and more users. But that will be years later, and by then, the team will likely have come up with new ways to spend the currency to keep the game going. 

So - 9 SOL too hefty for you? No worries, you can either wait for the rental system to be implemented a few months later, or sit on the sidelines for maybe a year until our player base matures and you can enter at a lower cost";2022-03-07 20:19:30;t3_t82gj9;/r/StepN/comments/t82gj9/where_do_i_get_these_sneakers/hzr65l4/;1;[{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7359461188316345}];Negative

Can I ask how much was the incoming transaction fees in the Stepn Wallet?";2022-01-21 07:42:08;t3_s777uc;/r/StepN/comments/s777uc/my_first_week_with_stepn_sneaker_nft/htkr3so/;1;[{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9063409566879272}];Positive

5399;Embers-Semen;"StepN has changed my perspective on the NFT ecosystem.

I was recently introduced to StepN through another NFT project and instantly knew I wanted to participate in the project. 

I read through the discord announcements/whitepaper and understood I needed to invite 3 people and get an NFT. 

I got my 3 invites and grabbed a runner off the floor at 3.19 SOL. Now wishing the floor was a jogger but I'll take it now looking at the 5.5 floor not even a full week later.

I haven't exercised in about 1.5 years. Work from home and covid has put a real damper on my health. 

I've ran on average 10minutes a day everyday (even at 1am because I had a super busy) to take advantage of the energy and GST earning.

In total I've earned about 20 GST valued now as of this post $60 USD.

I will be burning this GST to upgrade/repair my NFT. 

Thank you StepN for making my life healthier and have fun at the same time. 

The community is also super great and supportive with any questions. 

I have high hopes for this project and will continue to be a supporter.

With love, @Smelly_Doge#0896

5401;alijprof;"My strategy:  
I want to start by saying, this is what I am doing and it is by no means what you should do but it is working well for me.  
I started off with being rewarded for being a bug catcher and early bird in the closed beta with an uncommon shoe box (very lucky). I traded the market a bit when it was first listed on ME and got enough to get 2 uncommons and 2 commons. I now have 6 sneakers split 3 uncommons and 3 commons, it would be 7 but I just sold one of my uncommons. I did this as I want to start saving some to buy into the IDO and I am currently all in on   
STEPN nfts. Might be crazy but we’ll find out in time, I think this game a has a lot to come so hold tight.  


Minting:  
Shoe-Minting Event (SME) is when players use two Sneakers they own (Vintage) as a Blueprint and produce one Shoe Box (containing a New Sneaker). Every vintage combination gives a different probability on what shoe box you receive.  
I have been able to mint using my 2 uncommons giving me 100% probability of getting another uncommon shoebox. My advice would be to save your uncommon’s mints until you have another one to do it with. This will maximise your potential ROI. To further maximise your minting you should keep a hold of your newly minted to mint with a previous, this will lower your minting cost average. Then this can be done with the next sneaker you mint and so on.  
It is important to remember that all combinations give different results so it important to read the whitepapers to ensure you are maximising the probability of what you want.  


Levelling:  
By burning GST, players can level up their Sneakers from Lv1 to Lv 28. The number of tokens required to level increases exponentially as the level progresses.  
For levelling, I have been increasing 2 sneakers as quick as I can and have been able to get them to about level 19 so far. As for my other sneakers I have been getting to level 5 to allow for more mints. I don’t see the rush in getting them all to level 10 just now as renting won’t be out for quite a while yet so GST is better spent elsewhere IMO. Basically level the one you use and like the most up first and then play around with the others to mint or sell or accumulate. Whatever suits you best.

Attributes:  
The sneakers have a mixture of 4 attributes which allow you to earn more in different ways while you move. These are:  
\- Efficiency  
\- Luck  
\- Comfortability  
\- Resilience  
The question is where do you allocate your points when you level up?  
For the sneakers I use I have prioritised efficiency and resilience with a roughly 3:1 split respectively. That will allow me to earn more while lowering my repair fee. I have however got a sneaker with high stats in everything and 1 with allocated points given equally to all 4. I think a more equal allocation will be better when the game advances and becomes more balanced but for now efficiency and resilience are king in my book.
